However, we were given a flight voucher due to seating inconvenience, for $150 which is only good on a United airlines only. Even if booking through United Airlines website and the airline is operating under United Airlines you cannot use, so if you're flying out of the country it is useless.  Other than that I love United airlines we flown with them for several years on multiple trips. But I would like to make everyone aware that this voucher isn't all it's cracked up to be. Especially when most of your flying is international anyway. And they have also stopped doing a One-Stop flight from most places in the United States until the seasonal - which is generally November through Easter.

1,"✅ Verified Review | I travel frequently and United consistently lacks in quality compared to American, Southwest and Frontier. The customer service here needs serious improvement, for example today I asked a flight attendant if there was any room left in overhead compartments for my carry on (even though this is still 7 minutes or so until boarding ends and all of the compartments had been closed early) very kindly and politely and the response was completely rude and dismissive to my question she told me ""that can comfortably fit under your seat, in the most condescending offensive tone"" well I am a 5'10"" woman whose knees already touch the seat in front of me and would like to be able to enjoy my flight. She acted like it was too much to ask and so I then had to be uncomfortable unnecessarily on a flight that I paid for. So instead of arguing about it, as it was not worth my time and energy I then said forget it and then just bitterly deal with it the rest of the flight. I am very disappointed with the quality of this service, it's a Friday afternoon and the last thing anyone wants is to start their weekend feeling annoyed.",False,"The review is about customer service and lack of quality, not about the upgrade policy.",Negative,False,"Review focuses on customer service and carry-on storage, not the frequent flyer program value",Negative,False,"""""",Negative

This is such a ridiculous policy and one that has cost them two new customers.

4,"UA1541 (Tegucigalpa - Houston, 737 / Boeing 737-700), UA1699 (Houston - San Francisco, 789 / Boeing 787-900), and UA1 (San Francisco - Singapore, 789) on 17 Jun 2016. First, UA1541. Surprised to see that there was a personal screen, but it was with DirecTV and pre-recorded movies, and not available free of charge. However, in the end movies were made available free of charge, presumably due to slight delays on the ground at the start of the flight. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a wrap, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). I had wanted the sandwich but it was out of stock. Next, UA1699. In-flight entertainment was miles ahead since it was newer, though I notice the selection was less compared to my next sector which was a 16-hour international flight. Food was available for purchase, though the usual snacks and drinks were available free-of-charge. I did not buy anything, and survived on a zesty snack pack with Sprite. My seat was supposed to be window seat, but the window was misaligned so I had to lean forward to gaze outside. It was great to have no one sitting next to me in the middle, which enhanced the amount of space available considering that the Dreamliner in 3-3-3 seating is known to be rather cramped. Finally, UA1, newly launched earlier this month. I had expected it to be very painful to fly 16 hours on a cramped 787. It turned out to be uncomfortable but still bearable. Managed to get some light sleep, managed to be sufficiently entertained too. What failed me was the food. The first meal (dinner), I made the wrong choice and had a (vegetarian, but you dont know until you get it) pasta with just spinach, cheese and tomato sauce. Salad was as usual horrible. Luckily the ice-cream saved the day. In between I missed the turkey ham roll as I was asleep, but it was available at the back of the plane for self-service. That was helpful to stave off hunger pangs. The second meal (breakfast) was literally the worst in-flight meal I ever had. I did not have a choice as they had run out of the eggs, so there was only a (vegetarian again) noodle in some funky weird black sauce, with weird tasting mushroom, edamame (horrible again) and red pepper. Absolute disaster, so bad that my neighbour and I did not finish the food. Without the bun and butter I would have starved. Seat comfort-wise, legroom and width was okay though my friend who was a bit bigger sized and seated at the aisle could feel a significant narrower seat width compared to the other flights - his shoulders were up against the neighbour in the middle seat. Overall, service and food on board seemed to be not as good as my outbound flights from NRT to SAL via IAH, though the in-flight entertainment was better on the newer Dreamliner.",True,"Describes experiences with three different flights, mentioning issues with in-flight entertainment, food quality, and seat comfort.",Negative (complains about various aspects of the flights),True,"Describes experiences with UA1541, UA1699, and UA1 flights including in-flight entertainment, food, and seating",Neutral (complaints are balanced with positive experiences),True,"Describes experiences with three different United Airlines flights, mentioning issues with in-flight entertainment, seating, and food.",Negative (complains about various problems during flights)

In 5 days a flight was cancelled, our bags got lost, other flight was late, making me lose a connection flight and making me stay one night in the connection city. They didn't even want to give us a hotel voucher because it ""was not their fault"". Most of the company workers treat customers horribly with bad manners and being rude, with some rare exceptions. The workers are never there to help you. When you ask for their help for ticketing or luggage issues they simply say: ""There is nothing we can do"". United Airlines managed to mess up me and my family's vacation in a few days. So my recommendation: Never fly with this horrible airline.

10,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tel Aviv to Newark. I Put out some extra dollars for “Premium plus” cabin which was touted as business class comparable. Cost just over $3000 round trip for the ticket and not with it. Firstly - I was denied access to the lavatory right in front of me, mind you I did not have to pass through or by Polaris cabin. The fact that the toilet was not available to premium plus cabin customers would have been ok if that was the policy except that everyone else in my cabin was using it and even economy class customers. On asking why I was denied the flight attendant rudely replied to use the lavatory at the back in economy where my seat was although I indicated it was in premium plus. Secondly, the meal I was served was the same as economy class although it was advertised to be the same as Polaris. The economy class packaged meal was cold as a dog’s nose, the bread was stale and crumbling apart - and when I told the flight attendant, mind you I mentioned that I knew it was not her fault and would be happy with a snack or some chips to which she said no, she went on to Insult me and said that it was my fault that the meal was cold to my amazement? I immediately thought to myself - I just be in the twilight zone! She then signals to other flight attendants and points at me in an aggressive manner. At no time was I disrespectful or raised my voice. Now this made me very embarrassed and concerned for my safety so After declining to participate in any further refreshments out of fear and sitting quietly in my seat for 10 + hours into the flight, the flight attendant comes up to me and asks why I did t eat or drink anything for the approx. 12 hour flight and if I wanted anything just when the pilot instructs to fasten seatbelts for us to land. Really? I cannot comprehend why I was treated in such a poor manner but will be sure to spread the word as far and as wide in as many forums as possible in as many languages as I could This is the Worse Customer experience I’ve ever encountered and exacerbated as I was fearful for my wellbeing and worried of being victimized by the flight attendant.",True,"Poor treatment in ""Premium plus"" cabin, denied lavatory use, served cold economy class meal, flight attendant insult and aggressive behavior",Negative,True,"Poor treatment in Premium Plus cabin, denied lavatory use, served economy class meal, and felt embarrassed and unsafe.",Negative,True,"Poor treatment in Premium Plus cabin, denied lavatory use, served economy class meal, and felt insulted by the flight attendant.",Negative

30,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Hong Kong. This was my first time flying a United long haul international route. I made sure I included long haul since you can fly a 90 minute international flight from Chicago to Toronto which is no different from their domestic service. I flew in their soft-release of Premium Economy on my way to Hong Kong, and regular economy in my return flight. I say soft-release since in reality you only get the new seats, and not the full service which goes live down the road - the new seats are great! I got into these seats due to the new 777-200 configuration on my trip to Hong Kong which is a 3-4-3 setup in economy, and 2-3-2 in Premium Economy. I had a front row seat which means the tray and TV comes out from underneath the seat, and both worked really well. The seat itself is wider than regular economy by a couple of inches, and you can feel it. It also reclines by an inch more which didn't make much of a difference to me since I need a full bed to sleep well, but it was nice to lay back a little more with the foot rest they provide. You have a nice little storage container on the side of the seat which is perfect for tablets and smart phones, and the chargers worked great. It charged my phone up quickly, and it was easy to open and pull out my tablet when I watched some shows. The screen these new seats have is notably wider, and had a very responsive touch screen that worked well, and the quality was in HD. I watched the latest Mission Impossible, and the screen felt like a nice tablet now. On top of that, the entertainment selections were great. They had a lot of new movies, classics, and international choices. Overall if the Premium Economy is only a 25-33% upgrade cost, then get it for the seat alone. That said, I had the old 777-200 configuration on the return flight, and there is no Premium Economy seats yet. The biggest disappointment in the old configuration is no chargers, or they don't work. I know the old configuration is on it's way out, thank god, but they haven't been touched much since the 90s. United loses a point for not at least adding some proper chargers by 2010. Otherwise, it's a typical economy seat. Not bad, but nothing notable. Finally, the service itself overall was good. Obviously your crew will vary, but it seems like the international crew to and from Hong Kong was friendly and top notch. They had all announcements in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin which is great for the Chinese travelers on board. To me it says a lot how they accommodate foreign travelers to where you're heading. As I said earlier, the service was very friendly and active. Meanwhile the food isn't bad. The breakfast on United is quite good since I had the omelet on the way over, and the quiche on the way back. The dinner was okay, but overall it's 4/5 for the food.

33,"United Airlines staff at the airports and on the plane were polite and efficient. The smaller Embraer jets are nice for the single traveler, as they're designed with a single seat on the right side, so you get both window and aisle. The extra leg room in economy plus seating is worth the extra expense ($30-$45 on the segments I flew). The seats themselves are adequate, but not comfortable. This is an industry wide problem, and not in any way unique to United. The biggest disappointment is the WiFi service. From previous experience, it seems to work very well on their Airbus fleet. The Airbus fleet usually does not have tv screens in the seat backs, so the WiFi service on those planes comes with a library of movies and TV shows to watch. This works very well if you've got a tablet or some other device to watch them on. The Boeing portion of their fleet is another matter entirely. The more recent planes have the TV screens in the seats. There's a basic program that runs during the flight, but if you want to watch anything else, there's a fee. The WiFi service on the Boeing aircraft also seems to be spotty at best. It hasn't worked at all on 3 of the 4 segments I've flown in the last couple months. The Embraer planes fly the short routes. I have yet to come across one of these with WiFi service or a seat back screen. But, given the flights I've been on have only been about 90 minutes, this isn't a big problem.

First, our flight on Monday from Geneva to Newark was problematic and when we landed we received a cell phone apology and told that we could receive a ""token"" concrete apology if we went online (no thanks). At Newark our direct flight to Milwaukee was first delayed two hours due to the crew not yet arriving and then it was cancelled entirely. UA first told us that we would not be able to fly out until Wednesday evening, two days later than our schedule and they would not pay for any hotel accommodations! There was a United flight to Milwaukee within the next two hours but it was full. When we again asked about flights to other airports they told us we could fly to Minneapolis, stay overnight at our own expense, and then fly to Chicago on Tuesday and then from Chicago to Milwaukee later that day. When we asked UA to pay for a Minneapolis hotel (they cancelled the flight!) the UA rep said that the cancellation was due to an ""air traffic control situation"" so UA wasn't going to do squat for us. We took the Minneapolis flight and the UA rep said our luggage would be put on that plane but when we arrived in Minneapolis the UA rep there told us our luggage was sent to Milwaukee! So no change of clothes or toiletries, just what we had in our carry on. The UA baggage chief in Minneapolis was curt and dismissive, and couldn't have cared less about us. We are now sitting in the Minneapolis Airport at 5 AM (and 4 hours of sleep in the hotel) after being in transit for 36 hours from Geneva, and can only wonder what is in store for us on the next two legs of our trip home.

Due to a mechanical failure, we were asked to get off our flight from IAD-AMS after an hour on the tarmac. We were then asked to check back at the gate in an hour for a status update, at which point they told us to check back in another two and a half hours, though they were already pulling our bags off the plane. It was obvious the flight was not going to take off, but we were strung along for three hours. When it was finally cancelled, we were asked to walk a half a mile from service desk at D15 to C20. Once there we waited for yet another hour in line. Here is where it got absurd…At the desk the United Service Rep printed out a hotel and 6 meal vouchers for us. While they are printing, our Rep and the other customer service reps were looking at the vouchers and talking about the fact they just said ""invoice"" on them next to payment method and how that was not normal. The manager comes out and tells them that ""it will be fine and just keep printing them."" The Rep hands the vouchers to us and away we go. We wait in line for the shuttle then wait in line for the Westin service desk only to find out the vouchers do not work since there is no credit card associated with them or no established account with the Westin!!! After waiting to get on the phone with one of the United service reps at Dulles, the rep tells us we must go back to the airport to pick up a new voucher with a number! Fortunately Westin knows how to provide Customer service and convinces the United Rep at Dulles to just send over some form via email and puts us up even without a payment method. This negotiation lasted two hours. At this point we have been traveling for 11 hours with only 1 hour in flight. Also none of our food vouchers work at the hotel for the same reason.

We opted to catch the Coach Bus which actually worked out really nice getting us home only an hour & a half later that the regular schedule. I went on line and applied for the $31/per person bus credit and this was the response from United: Hello Linda, I'm sorry that your trip didn't go as planned and regret your flight was delayed due to Air Traffic Control delays. Your time is valuable, and we always work to make sure your trip goes smoothly. I regret that the weather caused us to fall short in this instance. We understand the added travel time and expenses and regret any inconvenience it may create for our passengers. Our airport co-workers are expected to do all possible to minimize the inconvenience. We do not cover added expenses in situations that are beyond our control. As this flight interruption was due to Air Traffic Control, we are unable to cover your added expenses. Your understanding is appreciated. If you purchased Trip Insurance, please let me know and I can provide you with a Flight Verification Letter to provide them. My Response back: I was told by a United Airlines Agent that there were no more flights out that evening to Milwaukee and that we'd have to wait until the next morning. Our options were to get a hotel room and food vouchers competed by United and catch a flight the next day or take a bus competed by United. So what part of this am I not understanding? I would have to guess that a $31 per person to catch a bus back to Milwaukee would be cheaper then competing us a hotel room, shuttle, food vouchers and another flight back to Milwaukee. The airlines should be responsible for air traffic control / bad weather conditions resulting in their customers missing their next flight due to their original flight being delayed not once, but twice. Take responsibility already United .. geez! Again please credit me the full amount of the 1-way bus ticket for 2 people from Chicago to Milwaukee. My next step will be to contact a supervisor/manager at United. This is ridiculous. United Response Back to Me: I thoroughly understand your point of view and again wish to express our true regret. I can appreciate your request to escalate your concern and I understand that you did not consider United's first response satisfactory. I am afraid we can only reiterate and convey our policies which we will continue to support. While this is not the answer you were hoping for, your understanding is appreciated.

We paid over $100 each to be in those seats and, at most, the seats should have been offered to other passengers in EconomyPlus seating. Instead, the PA announcement caused mayhem at the gate with many people rushing the counter. Our seats were exchanged for two seats in row 27. So, my husband was rolled to the plane in a wheelchair and then had to almost crawl to row 27. They could have offered the seats to passengers in row 8, for example - at least for starters.

For this particular trip, our flights were booked through Swiss Air, but our first flight of the day was operated by United. United does not have Curbside Check-in, and we are moving to another country for 2 years, so we have the maximum allowed baggage (2 carry on and 2 checked under 32 kg -- based on Swiss Air's rules). The guy at the counter told us we had to have a negative test result before we could get a boarding pass but the location of the Xprescheck (where we scheduled to get our tests) is in the terminal, so you have to have a boarding pass to enter. He finally decided it was okay to use our vaccination cards. Our bag was two pounds over. He said it would be $400 per bag that was over.  We repacked to make sure each bag was under weight.

55,"✅ Trip Verified | We flew United UA1872 from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Houston (IAH) on January 13th 2021, the last leg of trip back home to Houston from a Family trip to SE Asia. We spent time at O'Hare's United Club in Terminal 1 after transferring from Terminal 5 International arrival and stayed there for a couple hours waiting for our flight. The gate to our flight is just a few doors down from the lounge so we waited until boarding time before we leave the lounge. Boarding was done very orderly, First Class were called first then Economy were called by rows from back to front. Interesting concept of preventing Covid-19 transmission in this single aisle plane, letting First Class passengers get exposed to all Economy passengers passing them on their way to the back of the plane. Had this been a widebody this concept might work if Economy passengers entering from the second door, bypassing the First/Business Class passengers up front. It's obvious we are on an American carrier from the very tight pitch of seats, very different from Asian carriers we used in the past few weeks. The plane was clean even though it is kind of old (19 years - registration N37267). We used Clorox wipes to sanitize the tray table, armrest, seatbelts and screen when we got to our seat. We're back in the US so this is very important and it is something we have to do to keep ourselves safe! Movies and TV series from United's inflight entertainment program is enough for this short (2 hours) flight. I lost my wireless transmitter while transferring in Chicago O'Hare so I have to use one of the free headphones given by the FAs. The FAs on this plane are two older gentlemen and two older ladies. They were all very lovely, very laid back, helpful and cheerful. From how they help and interact with their passengers you can tell that they like their job. One of the FAs was even cracking jokes when she was making pre-departure announcement. I'd take them in a heartbeat over 95% of all other UA FA's that I have met in the past! The FAs were also very nice and approachable. They were open to chit chat when I was standing in the back galley stretching while waiting for a restroom. We were given sanitizing wipes when we were boarding, and a goodie bag with pretzels, stroopwafel and a small water bottle after take off. Then the FAs making rounds with the drink cart midway through the flight. We left 10 minutes behind schedule but arrived at 8.25 pm, around 34 minutes earlier than scheduled.

57,"✅ Verified Review |  I have flown United Airlines several times, and they have shown incredible consistency in being the absolutely worst airline. My negative experiences with the airline date back to 2007. As for the present trip under review from New York LaGuardia to Chicago, here are the most relevant issues. First, the flight was delayed leaving the airport by over two hours. There was no explanation given for what led to the delay while we waited at the gate. Second, the space between seats is simply unfairly small. I am a 5' 10"" man who is not at all overweight. And yet, my knees were pressed firmly against the seat in front of me, and the space was so small that I could not open my laptop computer to do work on the flight (my laptop is a MacBook Air, the thinnest model). Third, once in Chicago airspace we were told we could not land and circled the airport for close to an hour. When it finally appeared that we were going to land, the landing was aborted at the very last moment and were re-routed to Detroit. The problem: no information was given that we were heading there, just a little surprise when we arrived at a different airport. Upon exiting the plane, there were no gate agents there to help with booking connecting flights, only the personnel who dealt with lost luggage. I could actually say more negative things about this flight but am limited by space. Suffice it to say that I will absolutely never fly United again unless they are literally the only option in getting to my destination city.

67,"✅ Trip Verified | I'm a frequent business and pleasure flyer and flying United was the worst air travel experience I ever had. I bought a business-class flat bed ticket on United 363 from Newark to Honolulu leaving on 12/17/2020 at 9:50am. I required a business class level of service due to my injured spine with multiple herniated discs. Due to the snowstorm on the night of 12/16-12/17, I had difficulty finding a taxi and getting to the airport, and I arrived at the airport 50 minutes prior to my 9:40am departure. I had already checked in to my flight online and just needed to drop off 1 bag, which is technically still within United's 45-minute window submitting luggage for domestic flights. However, when I inquired about business class service, United personnel had no idea where to direct me. At first they sent me from the 2nd to the 3rd level of Newark Terminal C, however the United personnel there claimed they don't service Hawaii and sent me back down to Level 2, which was all Economy and big lines. I tried approaching multiple United personnel and all of them refused to help me and directed me towards Economy lines. Soon, they claimed I was too late for my flight - but I wouldn't be late if they did their job from the beginning and assisted me with priority service! At this point I was sent to wait in a massive line for customer assistance (again, no business class service to be found). I would have missed every other UA flight waiting in that line, but I also called United customer service by phone, where United phone agent (the only helpful agent in this entire experience) helped me rebook for a flight that departed one hour later, at 10:50am with a connection in SFO. However, I was made to pay a $539 flight upgrade fee that was sold to me as an ""upgrade"" from business to 1st class, which in reality turned out to be exactly the opposite, a downgrade: an old upright seat with minimal recline that is vastly inferior to my previously booked flat bed business seat, and much worse for my back. I found this deeply unfair. Even after rebooking, checking in to my new First Class flight was again a nightmare and I almost missed it, too, with no one willing to assist me even as I followed the phone agent's advice and told United personnel that I was flying 1st class. Probably 5 or 6 employees shooed me away and told me to get into a line for Economy electronic kiosks (half of which weren't working) and a long Economy passenger line for bag drop-off. The computer kiosk (when I finally got to it) again claimed I was too late to register baggage for my newly re-booked flight, but I miraculously found one competent UA agent who helped me overcome this. All in all, I had an absolute worst nightmare flying experience of my life. The physical pain in my back flared up from all of the dashing between floors, kiosks, and lines that I was made to endure with no one able or willing to help me. The service I received from United was absolutely abominable and especially so for business/1st class, and frankly it was horrible for any human being in any class to be subjected to such humiliation, physical pain, and monetary deprivation (which was unreasonable because I was actually downgraded, not upgraded). Online complaint with UA resulted in a generic ""you were late and we won't do anything"" answer (arriving 50 minutes should have absolutely been accommodated for a business class traveler who already checked in).

When I went to check in I found out I didn’t pay for my luggage it was an additional $60. So I should have bought the basic ticket which in the long run would’ve save me quite a bit of money.

The cabin made an outdated impression and signs of abrasion were found everywhere; cables fixed with tape, worn armrests and not working lights were just a few of them. The cabin staff was split half-in-half: 50 per cent were very friendly and seemed to care about passengers, however, the other half behaved like their job is a tremendous burden for them and customers seen as a factor of distress. The selection of food found in the menu was good but the quality of the served meals was bluntly put an impertinence; especially the meat was flavourless and rubber-like. The beverages were much better, though the coffee was another letdown.

140,"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Philadelphia via Chicago. United used to be a good airline company. In the past, if you’d book a coach seat, you would have a carry-on and a check-in bag included, and if you had an extra bag, it was still ok, no extra fee. You would get a free meal, and the entertainment, although it was on the minimalist side (because technology was not what it is today), was properly working (at least, most of the time). Not anymore. Today, well, where do I start? You book a basic economy seat for a price that is proportionally the same as for an economy flight in the past, and you have to pay for virtually every single thing on top of that. Only one small item allowed with you on the plane (I guess United figured that you might need a pair of extra underwear and socks if you go to the other side of the country) and they will give you a hard time if you bring a second one (like your camera bag, for instance). Which means that, if you bring a small item with you, along with a luggage of carry-on size, they will ask you to check that luggage in and you will have to pay a $25 fee. If you have an actual check-in luggage on top, that will be considered second check-in luggage, an extra $35. If you book a round trip, that’s already an extra $120 on top of your ticket price. Now, note that I am traveling alone. Imagine being in that situation with a family. Once you are on the plane, no meal other than the usual boring pretzels and a glass of cheap soda or juice. Prices for extra food/drinks are, of course, comfortably marked-up (food and drinks that are of questionable quality). I’m not even mentioning the ever missing extra blankets despite the still totally dysfunctional temperature management on the plane. Now, moving onto the entertainment part: extraordinarily, United has managed to make the ticket payer, use your own electronic devices and ear sets, so they can save thousands of dollars by not having to build-in an entertainment system for your plane section. How amazingly smart is that? Instead, they royally connect you to their internal server (of course, if you want real internet, it’s extra. And not cheap) and allow you to download a ridiculously impractical software plug-in that, if you ever finally manage to download and use it, turns out to be the worst piece of garbage I’ve ever used on a plane to watch a movie. I eventually had to stop the experience. You simply can’t deal with a movie that is so chopped up by the constant disconnections from the server that it becomes literally unwatchable. By the way, absolutely zero electric or USB plug anywhere around your seat to recharge your devices. Only in selective rows. So, what comes next, United? Paying to use the toilets on the plane? Charging a fee to bring our own device? Another fee to have a reclining seat? Where does it end? How much money can you still manage to save on the back of the customer? Lately, almost every single time I took a United flight, I felt they were simply trying to squeeze every dollar out of the customer. I couldn’t wait to get out of the plane. Yes, you can always say other companies pull their own tricks on customers, that you have expenses, that the market is bad, etc. I travel all over the world, and many companies that belong to so-called “developing countries” are better than United Airlines and treat their customers better than they do.

We took extra precautions by calling them to make sure we were not charged, and were reassured that we would not be charged. One month later we find out in our credit card statement that we had actually been charged. This is not a mistake of charging 10$ extra to costumers, it's more than 3000$!

186,"✅ Trip Verified |  This whole trip was a nightmare from start to finish. When I got to BWI for UA730 leaving 6:10am for SFO on March 5th, the usually deserted United desk was a teeming mass of panicked passengers. When I looked for the self-serve boarding pass kiosks (I only had carry-on), I was dismayed to find that they were all gone. After the experience of a colleague with making a confirmation and then missing the flight due to car trouble, I make a point of only confirming at the terminal. Nonetheless, I tried the link on the text from United and it directed me to download the United app. I then had to wrack my brain to remember my United password, but was able to provide it. Once it downloaded and I confirmed, after some effort I was able to find the tiny ""boarding pass"" link. My phone was only 10% charged and I then had a race against time to reach the gate before I lost my digital boarding pass. I did make the flight, but barely. Too bad United didn't tell us in advance that they were making these changes. On my return flight the crew just stood there smiling while all the overhead bins filled up and the passengers, including me, were standing around helpless. They finally informed us that we would be allowed to put our rolling luggage in the first class bins. At my DIA connection the crew were again all smiles. Only after I was in the terminal did I realize that my hour layover was suddenly much shorter. The crew had failed to mention that the plane was thirty minutes late and maybe people with connecting flights should run? I further didn't realize at first because it seems that United has eliminated the arrival boards at DIA . I staggered to the gate as quickly as I could, only to arrive one minute too late (by the clock) and the gate attendant stonily informed me I could not board. My dismay was dispelled when a uniformed stewardess stopped next to me and she told him that she also needed to be on the plane (I think she said she had been on the same flight from SFO) and that she was ""dead-headed"", which apparently meant that although she wasn't scheduled to be crew on the missed flight, she would end up missing another flight where she was needed. The gate attendant told both of us he would see what he could do and called up his superior. He then told the stewardess that she could board but that I was still out of luck. I then asked for help rebooking. He informed us there was another flight to Baltimore but that it was too late to make the gate, so we would best go to the customer service desk in the other terminal. About maybe one hundred yards along (seven gates) I was shocked to see ""Baltimore"" on the gate! I rushed to it, but the gate was literally closed in my face and was again told I was too late. Apparently this was the flight the other gate attendant was referring to was this one! We could easily have made it if we had known! The flight was marked as being 10-15 minutes late so perhaps he was not aware of this? Nonetheless, it would have been easy to just call ahead and check or to tell us to run and hope.

189,"✅ Verified Review | United's Basic Economy fare gives employees a mandate to treat customers with contempt and provide sub zero service. Unfortunately, United fare's from San Jose to Washington via Chicago was the cheapest. I work for the City of San Jose and have to book the lowest fare. I figured the fare was the lowest because of United's recent issues and as a result I would get at least okay service. This has not been the case. I've now learned that United has now created a new class called Basic Economy, which apparently does not work with self check-in. I did not realize that this fare meant, not only would I have to check my bag but would have to pay $25 or $50 if I took it to the gate. My seats get assigned at the gate by rude agents. As required by this fare I was the last to board and saw many open seats. I got all the way to the last window seat I was told with a huff that taking one of the many open seats farther forward would be a $119 upgrade.",True,"Complaint about poor service and additional charges for United's Basic Economy fare, including issues with seat assignments and boarding.",Negative,False,"""""","Negative (for Basic Economy experience, but that's not the category)",True,United's Basic Economy fare has extra charges/hidden fees,Negative
190,"Not Verified |  This airline is the worst airline I have ever flown with. I took off work to go to Chicago to celebrate a religious holiday with my family and was met with a bunch of problems. First, my flight at 5:40 was canceled just hours before it was supposed to take off. I decided to go at 3 to wait on standby for the next flight to Chicago at 4:45, which is what was recommended on the phone by United Customer Service. I was 6th in line. The 4:45 one left and I was unable to get in. I waited for one at 7:30 but was also unable to get in. However, by that time, they told me that I am 2nd in line and had to wait 4 more hours for the next flight. I found out about an hour before the next flight at 11 that I was kicked off the waiting list for no reason. I tried to find anyone from United to speak to about this but there was absolutely no one there to help. One of the later flights at 11:30 kept getting delayed till about 1 in the morning, and as for the other flight, I was informed that I was, once again, the 6th in line. I spent 9 hours in the airport yesterday and I am sure United does not care about me or a lot of their other customers in my same situation.

191,✅ Trip Verified |  United has become absolutely horrible. From entering the airport to getting on the plane is a disaster. No one has any responsibility to the clients in any way. It seems as if they have designed the long lines and confusion to make your trip as uncomfortable as possible. No one knows why you must wait in one line after another checking and re-checking and triple checking your identity. Your address. Your destination. Your ticket boarding pass. Your height and weight. Your Covid test results. Getting to the airport now requires a minimum of 4 hours prior to your flight in addition to the extreme likelihood of a delayed flight or change of plan. In short-United Sucks. If you have a choice. Choose another airline.,False,"""""",Negative,False,"""""",Negative,False,"""""",Negative
192,"✅ Trip Verified |  United Airlines has become an inefficient, uncaring airline with bad service. Bad flight beginning to end, an pleasant start to a dream trip to Hawaii: flight was delayed because pilots arrived late, and then we waited another hour in the plane while they waited for paperwork to come. They allowed numerous passengers to bring 2 and 3 pieces of full size carry-on luggage, like suitcases and large duffel bags! Many passengers who followed the rules and only brought the 1 allowable piece of luggage ended up not having space in the overhead storage! When I mentioned something to the steward about that, she told me to just worry about myself. Really? Flight attendants never checked bathrooms, never replaced paper towels to dry hands or emptied the overflowing trash bins - halfway through the flight there were no hand towels, there were trash piles on the bathroom floor and trash actually in the aisle on front of the bathroom and the bathrooms were gross! Flight attendants could care less. To top it all off, we had to wait 45 minutes for our luggage at baggage claim.

197,"8th & 9th January 2016, LAX to MEL, United Airlines flight 98, Aircraft 789. Over Dec to January I flew with United Airlines on four flights in total spending over $3,500. I was scheduled to return home to Australia on the 8th of January, which turned into the 9th of January. People had boarded the flight ready to fly to Australia, little did they know they weren’t going to be on the plane for a further 24 hrs. After further mechanical delays (four hours later) to determine if the plane was fit to fly. United decided to cancel my flight to Melbourne. During this whole ordeal I was told different information from United Staff. We were accommodated for in terms of accommodation for the night, and were handed vouchers. The problem was United Staff were adamant that you could use the vouchers anywhere, but in reality when you showed people these vouchers they would not accept them. I had to pay for the extra day over in LAX out of my pocket. Originally I had a premium economy aisle seat on the first flight on the 8th January, on the return flight I received a faulty seat at the back of the plane in economy. I had been told at the service desk that my seating would not be downgraded. Not only was my seat downgraded, the seat I received was faulty. After talking to United staff on the plane, to my surprise staff didn’t try to accommodate myself. This 24 hour delay resulted in me missing a day of work.

As expected, United Airlines dropped the ball yet again. They tell me on the same day as my flight that my flight has been delayed nearly three hours because of a mechanical issue that occurred several hours earlier in the day (without an explanation as to why this translates into a delay in my flight) resulting in my inability to make my connecting flight.  So, they basically say you can fly the next day and offer no form of real compensation for the inconvenience (they never do and will fight tooth and nail not to except perhaps in the form of a voucher for another flight with them). This resulted in wasted money and time on Lyfts to and from the airport and an unnecessary delay in the trip. The smug expression on the lady at the airport's face said everything about how little she cared about the inconvenience this had on a customer. Thanks a lot, United. Whenever someone asks me which airline they should fly, I recommend all of your competitors and recommend specifically that they do not fly United if they can avoid it. You know why?
