Would give a \u201c0\u201d if i could! All the flight attendants in our flight were so rude, no manners and very unprofessional! Our flight was from LOS ANGELES to SYDNEY on United 839, departing 18th January 2024. We encountered 3 flight attendants, and not even one of them was decent!! We have never been treated this way with any other airlines! We travelled as a group of 6. One of our 4 sons has nuts allergy. The man asked if he wanted butter chicken or pasta. And my older son told him that his brother has a nut allergy. The man said. \u201cWell I don\u2019t know if the food contain any nuts. You need to request it prior to the flight.\u201d Then he just walked past and served others. My husband had to call him and said, \u201cMy son didn\u2019t get his food. He wanted the pasta!\u201d No apology from him! For breakfast time, he also missed my eldest son. Then my husband called him again, and the man said so rudely, \u201cWell he didn\u2019t respond to me so I thought he didn\u2019t want it!\u201d We sat behind our 3 sons, and we definitely saw that he only asked our son on the aisle seat. He went past so in hurry serving other customers on the other side. We couldn\u2019t believe how rude he was! Second flight attendant was also very rude! My 5 year old son was sitting next to me on the window seat. He is the most well behaved 5 yo kids I know. During the entire 15 hours flight, he was quiet, sleeping well, and sitting happily playing games on his iphone and watching the in flight movies. Around 5am he was already awake, so he started playing piano on his phone. It was not loud at all, because I was sitting next to him. There was a point he put the volume to max for 2 seconds, and I told him to turn down which he immediately did. Suddenly this woman came to my husband, and said in a very rude and aggressive way, saying, \u201cHe is not supposed to play on his phone while everyone else is sleeping!\u201d I was very angry and said, \u201che is not even loud!\u201d I showed her the phone and the volume was 1. And she said, \u201cI was there and could hear him from afar!\u201d And just left! Unbelievable behaviour! The third attendant - we called the help button as my son needed something. She came and said, \u201cIt\u2019s very bumpy! We can\u2019t get out!\u201d (She could just wait for a few more seconds and said sorry I couldn\u2019t come right away!) Another incident, she gave my son the wrong breakfast. My 5yo were sitting on 50L. She gave him the food which labelled 50E. Luckily I checked first, it is a meal with special dietary/allergy requests. So we called the help button, it wasn\u2019t her who came to us. She said, \u201cOh glad you noticed that!\u201d My husband replied, \u201cOf course we noticed!\u201d It could have been a disaster that someone else\u2019s meal was served to the wrong person! No apology at all! No saying thank you that we actually didn\u2019t eat the meal! Such disgusting manners from all these 3 flight attendants. Our first time flying with United, and will never ever fly with them again! Our flight wasn\u2019t cheap too. Travelling 6 of us, we paid around $2000 AUD per person!

Flight ended and take off went on time without any issues on time around 11:45am. My wife and I were sitting in 54L and 54K. Flight security demonstration had to be done live because all of the economy class seat TVs were nonfunctional. This was an inconvenience to not have function tv but at least the flight departed on time. About an hour into the flight the captain came over the system to say they had attempted all their trouble shooting suggestions but had a malfunction that was not resolving so they were going to turn around. This was not ideal but hope was to get back to fix concern or reschedule the passengers. About an hour later it was said that we were unable to land because the plane had too much fuel so we had to continue to fly until it was safe to land. Eventually we landed but it was as if there was no true communication with the airport as they didn\u2019t know where to put us when we finally landed. They ended up taking us to a cargo area and because of this it took about an hour from landing until the maintenance crew could get to that side of the airport. Eventually which seemed obvious to me they eventually made us aware the repair would take so long that the flight crew would not have hours to fly even it it was fixed. This seems very obvious to me considering it was a 9 hour flight time and over 3 hours were wasted before maintenance even arrived to look at it. At this point they had no idea how to get us off the plane because we were not at a gate and they did not have authorized drivers to drive a bus to the cargo area. Eventually they stated they had 1 driver with the certifications to cross all those areas to get to us. They then kept acting as though the entire plane would get on bus 1, then on bus two when it returned, then with bus 3, and eventually I was offboarded on bus 5 over an hour since the first bus took the front of the plane. Concerning part is we did not pass over any run ways and several emergency personnel were driving the same route as us with out plane sitting next to empty passenger buses. The flight crew did not offer anyone water or food during this entire process 5 hours between boarding and offboarding with mainly elderly from many returning cruise liners. Even though the staff stated we had been rebooked on the flight for the same plane the following day with them we had no confirmations. When they pointed us to the person who had those answers they shrugged their shoulders and stated no idea but bags should be at #6 baggage claim. When we got there the entire plane was still there because no one had their luggage yet. The same barriers to get us offboarded also had them stumped on how to get our bags back to the main terminal. We waited another hour for bags to begin to come. The staff near the baggage claim kept saying everyone would be shuttled to a hotel and brought back in the AM for the rescheduled 9am flight but had no details of how any of it would happen.

But the experience on United ended up being extremely good. From the moment I checked in online I was kept informed of my flights, luggage updates through automatic SMS service. My flight was combined between Air Canada from Toronto to San Francisco on Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A321 Neo from San Francisco to Toronto and United on B777-300 from San Francisco to Sydney and back. In Toronto at the beginning of my trip, I was not able to choose seats on United for some reason which was a bit disappointing. I approached United staff at Toronto as well, and they said they cannot help me but the staff in San Francisco can once I arrive there. This was correct, as upon landing in SFO I found United customer service counter and they assisted me with changing my seat which was my desired option. I was very happy with that. Upon boarding, headsets were given, and we pushed back slightly before schedule. The flight was simply perfect. The food was very tasty (unlike many negative comments I saw here) and on SFO- SYD flight we got drinks with a dinner (butter chicken and some delicious red wine), snack in the middle of the flight and a hot breakfast (I took a waffle) which was also delicious. The crew offered water and drinks numerous times during the flight, they also cleared the cabin again and again, so I never had any issues with garbage being not collected. The drinks were also available in the galley and pretzel snacks. The crew (two very sweet guys) were very chatty, friendly, and kind. Toilets were clean throughout the flight as well. Upon landing in Sydney, we reached the gate without issues, disembarked and the luggage was there shortly after. On the way back, it was a daily flight, the flight left the gate ahead of time as well, the crew were super friendly during boarding and gave alcoholic wipes for hand hygiene and headsets. Upon take-off, snacks and drinks were offered first, followed by lunch (creamy chicken with rice) and upon clearance they offered water bottles to all passengers. During the flight the crew were often seen in the cabin helping out and chatting with passengers. The rest of flight went really well as well. Entertainment was great both ways and free Whatsapp service was very much appreciated by me. All together, no complaints at all, United was extremely good for what I was expected and treated me very very well on my way to Australia and back. And the crew were stunning.

The flight attendant who was responsible for distributing cookies and snack boxes shortly after takeoff, left a lot to be desired in terms of customer service. Her demeanor throughout the interaction was quite unpleasant. When offering passengers the choice between a cookie or a snack box, including myself, she came across as curt and impatient. It became even more problematic when passengers had additional questions or hesitated in making their choice; she responded with visible annoyance, leaving passengers feeling embarrassed and disrespected. I understand that everyone has off days, and I am generally forgiving, but this incident crossed the line in terms of acceptable customer service. Flight attendants play a crucial role in ensuring a comfortable and safe flight experience for passengers, and their demeanor should reflect the airline's commitment to service excellence. Her attitude felt dismissive and, at times, borderline hostile. It raises the question of whether the airline thoroughly screens and trains its staff. I hope that United Airlines takes this feedback seriously and considers addressing this issue. It is instances like this that could make passengers like me hesitate to choose United Airlines in the future.

United lied and told us our bags were now going to catch up with us in Nice, then Naples. This literally went on for 4 weeks. Everything we did to call United, email, and text them, was a waste of time & a whole lot of money. They misled us because in reality the airline never really knew where our bags were. We incurred thousands of dollars in expenses, we lost thousands of dollars of our personal belongings, all to come home at the end of the month in June to bags that remain gone. We called everyday and United told us a different city, country, & state each time. We still have no bags now its two months later. The aggravation, energy, and money spent by us outweighs the mistake. Its unbelievable that in this day and age United (or any airline) still doesn't have a better system. Now, two months later, they told us to file a claim. We've had to deal with the major inconvenience of losing money with extra changes, travel expenses, replacing whatever items were most important, and time spent that we lost while dealing with the airline. The hold times we spent on the phone overseas and after our vacation to the dysfunctional people who misled us at United Airlines, etc. When we were told to make a claim I have to say, United Airlines makes it tough to make a claim easily. The website is flawed, there isn't enough room for our information and/or receipts (they allow you to upload 10 receipts for reimbursement only). United makes it so tough to make a proper claim which is a tactic to deter travelers from even making one. They do this to frustrate an already extremely frustrated passenger so they can cover their own asses. Its inconvenience at its best. Then, they tell you you'll need to wait up to 10 weeks for your claim to be answered. By then, your loss is already in the thousands. After all of the drama, lies, misleading information, you'll get exhausted and the trip basically (no matter how beautiful) is tainted and thats all you really remembered in the end. Its unfair! Its violating. It is inconvenient and not worth it. United Airlines is totally at fault. We were even told at one time that our bags were in Minnesota, then Houston. Come on!

My husband and I have had perpetually horrible flight experiences with almost every flight in the last 4 months being delayed.

With our boarding starting at 4:15 pm, we started receiving 15 minute updates with delay notifications , which eventually turned into 30 minute delay notifications only to have our flight fully cancelled at around 8:30pm. I empathize with the desk staff as they had no control and were clearly being kept in the dark as well. We were missing flight crew. That's it. Our pilots were onsite along with one stewardess but we needed two additional flight crew in order to get in the air and United couldn't make it happen. After speaking with a member of the United staff, I was told to book the 5am flight, but was later informed by another United insider that it was a huge risk because we may very likely be in the same situation. We ended up canceling completely and moving to Delta - Bear in mind I will need to spend all day on the phone fighting for a full refund as that is not their first course of remediation. All in all, they aren't worth it; fly with another airline. My husband who travels occasionally for work had two other flights in the past three months fully cancelled on him, while I (who also travels for work) mostly experience long delays. I don't care about the points I have accumulated thus far, they are too awful to stay with and I recommend choosing any other airline.

If anyone came up to ask a question, \"Y'all have to hurry and board because we are about to go illegal\". She informed us, they would start boarding sooner due to them about to go \"illegal\".

Secondly, I arrived at Newark, and it takes United 30 mins to get an associate to hook up a ramp for passenger departure of the aircraft.

At this point, they give me a hotel because I had an international flight. I asked several times if my bags would be on the new flight I'd been given, the United assistant reassured me they would. (It was not on my next flight after delayed for 10 hours.) The assistant gave me a meal voucher of $15 for breakfast and lunch. They provided a Lyft to the hotel, by this time, it was 12 am. The hotel was about a 20 min drive, and I felt like I'd passed a million hotels to arrive at such an unsatisfying one. You would have thought I was in a motel 6. After a 10-hour delay, I started my travel back to Newark (EWR), my international flight was on time, I was so happy to be away from this unprofessional airport. The staff was horrible going through security check out. I arrived to Aalborg, Europe to discover, no one knew where my bags were. I'd missed my anniversary and now I have absolutely No clothes. Returning flight: From Aalborg, Europe (AAL) to dreadful Newark (EWR), I arrived at Newark Airport (EWR) again but this time I had an 8-hour layover. I'd learned from my first experience to just take the extra time if you can. I put myself into the Newark International Airport Marriott, which is only 5 mins from the Airport.

You have the choice to stay here in Birmingham or fly to Houston and we will provide a hotel room. Okay we chose to fly to Houston because who knows what could happen. We end up in a storm in Houston no fault to United Airlines but the issue is we lost a day in Honolulu and our room there was already paid for no refund issued. So we fly 7 1/2 hours straight to Honolulu on a crowded flight having to sit in the middle when our seats were originally by the window.

The flight back wasn\u2019t even better. We got delayed in Los Angeles because the flight attendant was late in Honolulu. Then we go to customer service and they did accommodate us at another hotel with food vouchers. However the experience was horrible because most of the staff was rude and disingenuous on how to handle customers. Things could have been worse but paying for baggage, being re-seated on every flight was all too much and even with them putting us up in hotels. We still lost money and a day in Honolulu.

Now, this by itself was very frustrating and meant we would miss a whole day of our vacation, no vacation and no work meant we were losing money by the hour, add onto that was the unhelpful attitude of the flight crew, the several different reasons given for delays (ranging from weather to flight crew deficiency, to plane malfunctions) and this was just a really bad day.

We were flying from Boston to Calgary, Canada via Newark with my two elderly parents (one of whom has a back problem and gastrointestinal issues) and my 5 month old baby, who was flying for the first time in his life. On the morning of our scheduled departure, United told us that the Boston-Newark leg of our journey was delayed because of an earlier delay impacting our plane\u2019s arrival, meaning we would not have sufficient time to make our Newark-Calgary connection. We spent over 2.5 hours on the phone with United trying to find an alternative flight, but were informed that the earliest available alternative was not for another two days on April 18th, 2023, even though we showed great flexibility e.g. we were willing to connect via a different city, split our family up so we flew on different airplanes, and / or accept a longer connection time. Despite this, United said there was absolutely no option for us to fly for another 2 days. They also confirmed that the reason for the earlier delay was boarding of the aircraft taking longer than expected, which was within their control. We looked ourselves into flying with another airline, but the cost of such last-minute tickets was thousands of dollars per passenger and therefore prohibitively expensive. This meant cancelling our United flights and getting a refund was not a feasible solution. United did NOT offer us the option of arranging a flight with a different airline carrier without additional expense, which is contrary to our rights under Canada's Air Passenger Protection Regulations (APPR). We therefore accepted the new United itinerary on April 18th. We were appalled that United was not able to re-schedule us for two full days.  Our destination city of Calgary is not a small town - it has a population of 1.45 million people and a very active international airport. We were stuck in Boston during the very busy Boston Marathon weekend, which forced us to stay at an expensive hotel 2 more nights than we planned as we could not find last minute accommodation elsewhere. We incurred additional meal costs and transportation costs to the airport. Our total additional expenses during our delay period WAS USD 1,110. We filed a detailed complaint with United Customer Care. It took them close to 2 months to reply to us, and when they did they vaguely blamed the weather (first time we heard of this excuse!) and refused to compensate us at all."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "June 2023", "review": "\u2705 Trip Verified | Extortionary Luggage Fees.

As far as United clubs go, this one isn't too bad, with great views of the airport, hot and cold food on offer, and the highlight: a Dole whip soft serve machine. When I went to the face for boarding, I arrived just in time for group 1 boarding, and found a pillow and blanket on my premium plus seat for this red-eye flight. I had paid an extra $215 for this seat which I think is good value, especially for a red-eye. It was basically a narrow-body business class seat, a big lazy-boy if you will. The flight taxied out to the runway, made a turn on to the runway then turned off the runway. The first officer announced that they had an issue with the radio and they would try to troubleshoot it there, however we had to return to the gate as the pilots couldn't troubleshoot it. United messaged us a new departure time of 00:30 (originally 22:30). During the delay, the cabin crew walked up and down the aisles offering water to passengers. At 02:00, the pilots had gone over their duty time and they deplaned all passengers. At the baggage claim, hotel and food vouchers for the Hilton Hawaiian Village as well as taxi vouchers were offered, but they did not announce this and only passengers who came to the service desk got these. The new departure time was set at 12:30, and I went to rest at the Hilton. The food voucher however allowed for only $15 per meal, which got me an orange, coffee and a yoghurt for breakfast. Thankfully with my Gold status I could use the ANA lounge when I returned to the airport and got a full lunch there, however other passengers would've had to pay the excess for their meals. The departure time got pushed back again to 17:15, and we finally pushed back at 17:29. To United's credit, the service onboard from the cabin crew was fantastic. They were genuinely happy to serve passengers and were genuinely happy to be there. The selection of complimentary snacks and beverages was slightly limited but considering the price of the ticket I couldn't complain. I didn't book anything for San Francisco for the first day, so I didn't miss anything. However the new arrival time of 01:30 meant I missed the BART to the city centre and ended up having to pay for an Uber. The return flight on the 757 wasn't as great due to the old cabin. Initially at the check in counter I asked if I could get a seat in economy plus, to which the response was \"$200.\" I asked again at the United club and they asked \"is an aisle seat okay for you?\" and got 10D without any extra charge. I think that the way United handled the delay relatively well in my case, although I believe my Thai Airways Gold status helped me stay fed during the delay. I wouldn't mind choosing United again, but I can't speak for all passengers on this incident."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "May 2023", "review": "Not Verified |  I will be flying Southwest from now on. I had a flight to Houston booked for this morning. I showed up to the airport with ample time to check a bag, make it through security, and board my plane, as I have about twice a month with United over the past year. After I wasn't able to check in on the kiosk, I was directed to stand in line and check my bag in manually. Unfortunately, I am not a wealthy, first class customer, so the line I was directed to stand in did not move an inch while the first class line continuously flowed. Over an hour later, I reached a representative. Keep in mind my line was not long, less than 10 travelers total, but if anyone occupied the first class line, regardless of when he/she arrived, that was the priority. So after an hour of waiting and getting pretty antsy because it was getting pretty close to my flight time, I finally reached a representative who proceeded to inform me that I was too late and that she could not check a bag without 45 minutes notice before the flight departure time. So I got to the airport with more than enough time to complete all tasks that I do on a regular basis with United, but because I choose to forego extra leg room and comfier seat on this short flight, I was deprioritized and ultimately forced to miss my flight. Southwest had me booked on a flight leaving an hour and a half later, the check-in and bag drop process were seamless, and I thoroughly enjoyed my flight, despite the stress of missing a meeting because of United's poor customer service. I will be closing my United MileagePlus account, and Southwest will get all of my future business and referrals."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "May 2023", "review": "\u2705 Trip Verified | When I checked in for my flight I was told my seat would be assigned at the gate. When I arrived at the gate the staff made me wait, then they told me that because I used miles to upgrade and the plane was full, that they downgraded me from business to economy. I told them I have a confirmed paid seat through corporate travel and their points explanation was incorrect. So I pushed to get a seat. They then told me that they gave my seat to a UA pilot. I challenged them again and said the pilot should sit in economy, again as I have a confirmed corporate travel booking. Finally after 15 minutes they finally gave in and I was presented a seat in 1E, business class. No explanation was given so I asked. They said a \"standby revenue customer\" had taken my seat. This I felt was unacceptable that they wanted to bump a corporate travel guest to get more money out of a standby customer. The standby customer was moved after boarding, so no doubt they were disgruntled too, and I sat next to the 777 pilot who had been evacuated from Guam before the typhoon. What I don\u2019t understand is that an airline is happy to downgrade its corporate customers to put a pilot in their seat, even though economy is available. I also think it\u2019s greedy to downgrade a corporate customer to take a standby revenue customer, when I had paid through work the full airfare. My understanding is that UA does not care for its corporate customers, ironically likely the ones keeping them in the air! And I booked through a travel agent so I guess UA has total disregard for their travel industry partners. That aside, the staff onboard were nice and did their best with perhaps the worst set of 737s in APAC, old and run down with terrible out dated business class seats.

And this was, of course, an inconvenience to my husband and me as we had a tight deadline once our flight landed to get our rental car and head to a business meeting. However, we were patient and complied. As we walked down the hallway to drop off our carryons, a fellow passenger came out of the plane and asked the worker for his bag back because he was told by a flight attendant that there was space in the overhead bins for his bag. Puzzled, we continued to drop off our bags and board the plane. Long story short, we boarded the plane to find an abundance of space in the overhead bins, which showed that we were essentially lied to by flight staff. For what reason I have no clue. Maybe to inconvenience passengers in the hope that next time they will upgrade their ticket? It couldn't be because of weight because the bags go to the bottom of the plane when being checked. Whatever the reason, my husband and I were incredibly inconvenienced. Once we landed and walked to baggage claim, we waited 30 minutes for our bags to arrive.

UA had a mechanical delay with the plane that forced us to arrive 4 hours later than planned. Traveling with children, we arrived at approximately 2 am to our destination (2 hrs from our final house-destination). Due to our late arrival, our rental car company (newark airport) was closed. Told we could not sleep in the airport, we found the cheapest newark hotel we could ($155), arriving about 3am. The next morning, we returned to the car rental to a 2-hour line. By the time we were served, they had only one car left (the lot was empty) with pax behind us; I guess, out of luck. The only rental option was an upgrade (for the week rental) that would eventually cost us about $180 additional to the pre-arranged economy car fare we had booked weeks in advance. I talked them down to $190 or it would have been more. All told, we incurred about $350 in expenses, some of which we requested refunded by UA. Now, five months later, I am still trying to get the compensation (any compensation). Had this been a weather-related or similar issue, I'd accept the loss. But it was mechanical (the Pilot and the support staff at the gate had both announced to the cabin the reasons for the delay). Eventually, they promised $200 citing that as their maximum. Then I was told that there could be no compensation for us since we incurred the expenses at our point of arrival (destination) .. which is bizarre since that would often be (almost always) the site of incurring expenses for a delayed flight,  especially because our destination was not our home.

I strongly believe that restricting a boarding pass for those passengers without carry-on bags is not only unnecessary, but also punitive to those who choose to check-in at the kiosk instead of online. As someone who often travels on basic economy class, I already experience the lowest possible service that you offer. However, the added layers of unnecessary steps only make the experience even worse. It is disappointing to see that you are needlessly adding extra steps that make me think twice about choosing UAL whenever possible. The needless step of checking with your staff for examination because of your lack of trust shows that you do not care about your economy class customers. It is unfair to assume that just because a passenger chooses not to bring a carry-on bag, they must be scrutinized more. This sends a message that you do not trust your passengers, which is not the best way to build a strong relationship with them. I suggest that you figure out a better, less punitive way to treat your good basic economy class passengers. This will not only improve the overall customer experience, but it will also demonstrate that you value all of your passengers equally. Thank you for taking the time to read my concerns.

This trip was to celebrate my birthday, on the 4th, and our 30th wedding anniversary, on the 6th. We were scheduled on a flight that left at 6:45AM and arrived pretty close to the time we needed to check our bags. Since there is a hard cut-off 45 minutes before the flight, we tried to go straight to the counter but a United employee insisted that we go to the kiosk first. She had trouble at the first kiosk and after a few minutes, went to a second kiosk, where she didn't seem to know what she was doing. We finally just ignored her and walked up to the counter. The gate agent helped us but because of the 5-10 delay minute caused by the first employee, we were TWO minutes past the hard cut-off to get our bags on the plane. That meant that we couldn't get on our original flight. She was able to book us on different flights but we ended up getting to Puerto Vallarta hours later than originally planned. We were scheduled to go to a highly recommended dinner/show cruise that evening but because of our late arrival we missed the show ($140.00 per person). Despite that initial mishap, the rest of our trip was great and we were looking forward to returning to Salt Lake on Saturday evening, the 4th, and then on Sunday, enjoying a 30th anniversary brunch planned by our four children and about twenty of our friends, neighbors & extended family. Unfortunately, our Saturday afternoon flight from Puerto Vallarta was delayed (no reason given) for several hours, causing us to miss our connecting flight in Denver. We arrived so late that there were no more flights on Saturday night but got booked us on a flight the next morning. The earliest we could leave was sometime around noon and we didn't arrive in Salt Lake until about 2:00, meaning we missed the 30th anniversary brunch our family had scheduled for us. We always try to be positive and make the best of bad situations. The incompetence of United Airlines caused us some major stress and grief, but we are focusing on the positive aspects of our trip and had a delayed celebration of our anniversary last weekend at our home with our kids and a few others.

When I got to BWI for UA730 leaving 6:10am for SFO on March 5th, the usually deserted United desk was a teeming mass of panicked passengers. When I looked for the self-serve boarding pass kiosks (I only had carry-on), I was dismayed to find that they were all gone. After the experience of a colleague with making a confirmation and then missing the flight due to car trouble, I make a point of only confirming at the terminal. Nonetheless, I tried the link on the text from United and it directed me to download the United app. I then had to wrack my brain to remember my United password, but was able to provide it. Once it downloaded and I confirmed, after some effort I was able to find the tiny \"boarding pass\" link. My phone was only 10% charged and I then had a race against time to reach the gate before I lost my digital boarding pass. I did make the flight, but barely. Too bad United didn't tell us in advance that they were making these changes. On my return flight the crew just stood there smiling while all the overhead bins filled up and the passengers, including me, were standing around helpless. They finally informed us that we would be allowed to put our rolling luggage in the first class bins. At my DIA connection the crew were again all smiles. Only after I was in the terminal did I realize that my hour layover was suddenly much shorter. The crew had failed to mention that the plane was thirty minutes late and maybe people with connecting flights should run? I further didn't realize at first because it seems that United has eliminated the arrival boards at DIA . I staggered to the gate as quickly as I could, only to arrive one minute too late (by the clock) and the gate attendant stonily informed me I could not board. My dismay was dispelled when a uniformed stewardess stopped next to me and she told him that she also needed to be on the plane (I think she said she had been on the same flight from SFO) and that she was \"dead-headed\", which apparently meant that although she wasn't scheduled to be crew on the missed flight, she would end up missing another flight where she was needed. The gate attendant told both of us he would see what he could do and called up his superior. He then told the stewardess that she could board but that I was still out of luck. I then asked for help rebooking. He informed us there was another flight to Baltimore but that it was too late to make the gate, so we would best go to the customer service desk in the other terminal. About maybe one hundred yards along (seven gates) I was shocked to see \"Baltimore\" on the gate! I rushed to it, but the gate was literally closed in my face and was again told I was too late. Apparently this was the flight the other gate attendant was referring to was this one! We could easily have made it if we had known! The flight was marked as being 10-15 minutes late so perhaps he was not aware of this? Nonetheless, it would have been easy to just call ahead and check or to tell us to run and hope.

I booked my flight several months ago, traveling with my little one under a year I made sure to book my trip with the least connections. I had troubles adding her on the reservation so I called the airline to get this done. They took quite a bit to help me but was told it was done, there was no added charge and I was going to receive a confirmation in a couple of days. I received an email with a link to the reservation details, when following the link I could see the 3 of us were booked and everything looked good. When check in time came I went to the website and it said I needed to check in at the airport because they first flight was thru air Canada. I showed up to the airport 2 hours ahead even though you only need about an hour for domestic flights. When I get there Air Canada can not find a ticket for my daughter they took a while trying to solve it but in the end they told me to contact United that it should be an easy fix as she was sitting on my lap. When I contacted United the agent treated us as if we were lying and we didn\u2019t register our daughter, he said there was nothing we could do and it needed to be done by air Canada, mind we told him we were at the airport with all our our bags and our little one and have about and hour and a half before the flight leaves. He said I needed to purchase an infant ticket for her and I said that I wasn\u2019t informed when I called to add her but we could pay her ticket if necessary. United kept telling me I should do that with the airport staff and air Canada kept telling me they can\u2019t do that\u2026 this took a while. When I saw the time was getting close and we were not getting anywhere, I asked if I could just buy an adult ticket for my daughter for this flight and just continue with the rest of the trip as paid, he said they didn\u2019t have my daughter at all, when I said I had proof that I had called to add her to the flight and her name in the reservation details he went again to talk to his manager (3rd time).. it seemed so unreasonable that they couldn\u2019t do anything when she was traveling on my lap. He came back and said they see her name but because it\u2019s international and we didn\u2019t pay for a ticket they couldn\u2019t help me. By this time we already missed our flight, we asked to be transferred to the manager after about another hour talking she said they could get us on another flight arriving to our destination 3 days later and with an overnight layover and magically, now she was able to get payment for a ticket for her? Both agents kept an unapologetic attitude even though we were not at fault. You would think that if you call the airline to let them know you are traveling with a kid and they take her name and info, they would tell you you need to pay a ticket. I reminded the manager how hard traveling with kids is, and that an overnight layover was not ideal, also that I had book those dates for a specific event that I was now going to miss. I told her that it was a major inconvenience on top of getting stuck at the airport with a little one and all our luggage for hours without them getting anywhere to now have to come back the following day. She basically said that all she could do to help me. I was so frustrated, tired, sleep deprived that honestly could not take anymore from United I asked for a refund and purchased a way more expensive ticket thru another airline - they really screwed me over and not once took ownership for their mistake."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "February 2023", "review": "\u2705 Trip Verified |  We flew United Airlines from Edmonton to El Salvador Feb 8 with connections in Denver & Washington DC on the way there.

The day we were scheduled to leave San Antonio to fly back to Knoxville via Houston, there was a weather event in Houston, which initially delayed our flight. Unasked, we were put on another flight into Houston. After sitting on the tarmac on that flight for around 2 hours, the pilot stated that the plane was overweight due to fuel, passengers, and baggage, and that they needed volunteers to deplane. The pilot also stated that he had never experienced such a situation in his 25 years of flying. Eventually, enough passengers volunteered to deplane and the flight departed for Houston. Once in Houston, we were informed that our flight to Knoxville had been canceled and rescheduled for the next day. By then, it was around 10 PM. I contacted United customer service via phone while my daughter stood in line at the customer service desk, which eventually closed before she reached the front of the line (there were 85-100 people in line.) The customer service rep I spoke with was hateful and rude, and informed me that, because our flight was canceled \"due to weather\", we could request cots to sleep in the airport or we could get our own hotel. We got an Uber to a hotel and spent the night, and arrived back at the airport the next day. The new flight went from Houston to Dulles. At Dulles, we boarded a very small Embraer via stairs from the tarmac. It was raining and the metal stairs were very slippery. To top it off, when I got to the top of the stairs, the flight attendant told me, very rudely, to go back down the stairs and gate check my backpack, which was the size of a purse. I was wearing two leg braces and barely made it up the steps to begin with because of severe osteoarthritis. The gate agent could have asked me to gate check the backpack. Someone on the ground could have asked me to gate check the backpack. No one did. Just the rude flight attendant. Luckily, my daughter was a few people behind me and could take the backpack back down the stairs. Again, in the rain. After all this, United sent us each a $150 travel voucher.

Going through security I received the normal security which means a body scanner, and many pat downs. I went to the lounge and the only hot food was tater tots and mushrooms. They did have wine. I would recommend the Lufthansa Lounge. Make sure you do not go through Passport Control, or it will be too late to get to the lounge.

When I asked the flight attendant why the flight was delayed an hour his response was, I don't know. After the dishes were collected, the fasten seatbelt sign came on not once but twice, not because of turbulence but because too many people were trying to use the toilet. Note to United, turning on the fasten seatbelt sign doesn't empty my bladder. The plane was full, no empty seats. One hour before landing, the pilot said, we are expecting turbulence in Newark so we will be preparing the plain for landing early. Toilets were locked, seats had to be upright and tray tables needed to be up. There was no turbulence arriving in Newark and I have flown with this pilot before. Five feet before arriving at the gate, the pilot made the announcement that we are five feet from the gate and already 28 people have their seat belt unfastened.

Our luggage (large, hard outer-case suitcase weighing less than 50lb) came out of the carousel about 70 minutes after arrival (along with everyone else's), and it had severe cracks that rendered the suitcase completely unusable in the future (the inner padding was exposed). I tried to tell an agent about this, but no one was present at the United counter at baggage claim. I chatted with an agent on United website about this, but without any apology, she told me to go to a different terminal to see an agent.

We were told we were going to land and be back up in the air shortly and that we were just waiting for the weather to clear. We then had to de-board the plane and wait inside a very small airport that had 5 total gates and 1 terminal.

We waited for 3 1/2 hours while only being told to not book a hotel room, and that United was going to get us back to Denver soon. This entire time, we were tracking other United planes that were landing in Denver hours before we were able to fly back. Finally, we re-boarded the plane and flew back to Denver, where the conditions were worse than when we originally attempted to land there.

We decided we would schedule a flight with a different airline for that night, and go down to the baggage claim to get our bags. We were told that United had submitted the request for our bags to be pulled and it would be 1-2 hours before they would end up on the baggage claim carousel. We sat and waited for 4 hours and still did not receive our bags.

This made a clear distinction during December 2022 Arctic freeze in North American continent - when airlines like Southwest could not schedule its pilots and dumped customers' luggage wherever they could. United kept most of its services intact with minimum disruption and maximum on-time performance; also United system is able to tell every customer where his luggage is at any point in his trip. The way and with speed at which United came out of COVID-19 was also seamless and shows its resilience. United's cleanliness during pandemic was way superior than others.

I was traveling to visit my fianc\u00e9 for thanksgiving. And I had just finished my last final in medical school so I was really happy but United ruined it. It all started when I tried checking in my bag. I am a United credit card holder so logically my first bag is supposed to be free. I tried adding the bag through the app but it kept charging me. So I contacted the customer service who requested me to seek help at the airport kiosk or the staff and reassured that it should be an easy fix. I agreed to it. When I sought help at the airport, the staff including the supervisor proceeds to tell me that I bought my flight with my miles so I am not eligible to check in my bag for free even though I am a card member. I tell them that the customer service rep confirmed that none of that should be a problem. They tell me to bring an email stating that. Now where am I supposed to find an email? I call the customer service again. Again, this is happening an hour and a half prior to my flight. The customer service rep tells me it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Miles are considered rewards not punishment. I try to hand over the phone to the United staff at MIA and they refuse to talk to him. They keep saying they want to see an email. The customer service rep tells me he can\u2019t send any email other than a generic one per the airline policy. So the United staff at MIA leaves me at that without any help. The customer service rep tells me that I should just pay for the bag and request a refund later. As much as I didn\u2019t want to go through the whole process of requesting a refund and all that, I agreed to it it because I didn\u2019t want to let this ruin my day. Then, I head over to TSA, the nice lady checks my boarding pass and points me to the general line. But this man comes in and asks me to get my ID out before I even enter the line. Note that, there is a huge line at TSA (I am no where close to the TSA guy). I tell him that I have it right here in my hand\u2019s reach but he won\u2019t let me enter the line unless he sees it in my hand. I tell him the line is so long and I don\u2019t want to drop it. Still, he won\u2019t let me go in until he sees my ID in my hand. I have flown so many times in my entire life and I never had anyone stop me at the beginning of line and manhandled me like this. Then at TSA screen, their machine breaks and they lose my mac. I end up finding it in another lane. oh also, my flight gets delayed. I am not exaggerating. This is all happening in the same day. Once I get in the flight, the flight goes smoothly. But now I am worried because the arrival time is too close to the departure time of my connecting flight. Even after everything happened, I was hopeful that United will do its due diligence like every other airline, and hold the flight for at least 10min because that should be enough to get the passengers in from the delayed flight. Also, perhaps that the crew members would help these passengers out first to accommodate the delay. I am sorry but that just has been my experience with American and southwest. They just understood and helped. Little things but made a huge difference. But United did not do any of those. They had zero communications and did not make accommodations. Couple other passengers and I ran 30 gate gates over in 10min just do find that they closed the gate even though there is 10min left, means there was no communication about the delayed flight.

Our luggage, for some strange reason took almost an hour after the aircraft landed to reach us after we landed. Then of course there was the traffic in the evenings in Paris. Had we landed at 10am we would have been to our hotel by 11am. The delay caused us to miss our reservation at the Louvre Museum. Nothing was available until the end of November, long after we were gone. We were never able to see our friends, since they flew out the next morning, and we missed an entire day of our vacation.

This flight was $2300, so not cheap. My return flight to SFO was originally scheduled on 7/27/2002, but due to strikes in Germany by Lufthansa covering the Athens-Frankfurt trip (UA 9312), I ended up being stranded with my daughter near Athens airport for 3 days. When going to the counter at airport to rebook one day before, it took me 7 hours on 7/26/2002 at the Lufthansa airport counter to get a new ticket. Lufthansa gave us a voucher for a hotel 30 min away from the city, with nothing to do around. Return trip was a complete nightmare. First at check-in, after 1.5 hours to get to check-in attendant, I am told I cannot check in my luggage until my final destination and that when they rebooked my ticket, they made a mistake and put my daughter as an infant instead of a teenager. We flew back on three different airlines from different alliances, which led to terminal changes both at CDG and JFK. This gave me no time for getting my luggage which ended up being stuck in France for three days. Under federal law, if an airline cancels a flight I am entitled to a full refund. United took two months to respond to basically deny any kind of compensation, since that law only applies to domestic flight. For my daughters trip, she had a round-trip starting from Athens and she was supposed to return to Athens. After this fiasco, we decided to cancel the return ticket. As of today, months later, we did not get refunded for the return, nor any compensation for the strike either. United is literally washing their hands of this issue and put all the blame on LH. What is the point of an alliance if they relinquish their responsibility to them. They should compensate me and negotiate themselves with LH. Here is the meagre and only email received from United Customer Care Team after working on my case for 2 months. They sure work slowly. Stopping business with this airline: \"I am sorry to hear your flight was cancelled with our Star Alliance partners at Lufthansa due to strikes in Germany.

I booked our ticket on AMERICAN EXPRESS travel page, we got a confirmed flight for AIR CANADA via UNITED AIRLINES. And it was NOT a PLEASANT one! I have been and still is working in Customer service ALL my 20+ years. And in all of those years working with 2 different big companies I was trained the VALUE of CUSTOMER SERVICE.

But, is it not when you are flying with minors especially when they are under the age of 10, Airline System must prioritize the family to be seated together during the flight? Just like what they advertised on their website? Well, It SURELY DID NOT happen to my family, as all 4 of us are seated on 4 DIFFERENT ROWS!! Is it not the reason Airlines have personnel working behind their computer to make sure that when an issue such as this arises they are there to fix it?? (Could it be their tactics to force you to pay extra money?) I have asked in multiple occasions the United Airlines personnel behind the computer to kindly seat us family together or at least myself and my 2 kids, as it will be hard for the kids, myself, as well as the one who will be seating beside them. Unfortunately, the 3 ladies kept brushing off my concern, so I have asked to speak with the supervisor but I was told that there was no supervisor on duty as it was the last flight? So then I asked for the one in-charge on that shift but she repeatedly told me \"that My family are on economy seats and they CAN NOT do anything and that I should have paid for a preferred seats!\". I have got no complain whatsoever to be seated anywhere on the plane, not even requesting a front or more leg room seat, I was just SIMPLY asking to be seated with my 2 young children. But all 3 of them kept saying that the flight is full, if I want I can just ask the other passenger to switch seats with me?? Here's what FRUSTRATES me about the CUSTOMER SERVICE of their personnel, in situation like this, WHY do I have to look after myself/my family we paid money too to be on the flight? Is it not their job to assist us? Also, why would they have their staff be on the floor, wear their Company ID's but not be allowed to show it? Since when in customer service industry, a PERSONNEL IS NOT ALLOWED to provide their name? (Calling out HR and management, is this how you trained your people?) Anyways, upon boarding, while looking for our assigned seats, my husband approached one of the flight attendant if there's anyway she could help us with the seats, as we were seated separately (too bad I can't address my family's sincere appreciation to HER as I'm told that getting their name is \"AGAINST company's policy\" as per the agent on the ground). SHE gladly assisted us and was able to seat myself with my son who's 5 and my daughter who's 8 with my husband. Again, shout out to her as she definitely turned the bad experience into a good one!

While waiting on the second change we observed the same type of jet (CRJ200) going to Aspen fully boarded waiting with a failure to start #2 Engine for over 1 hr. This is a real confidence builder! They finally gave us a new gate over 10 min. walk and of course there was a departure delay. When we boarded it was extremely hor as the A/C wasn't working properly. They assured it would be ok when we got airborne in 10 min. over 25 min we weren't rolling and it was getting worse! Finally we were in the air the A/C still wasn't working properly.

To say that this airline is awful is an understatement. My wife and I planned our honeymoon to Croatia using credit card points through AMEX and based on the points and the destination, we were advised to use United. The first problem with the airline is bin space and baggage allowance. Our first destination was to Washington DC from Houston and my wife had a bag that had many of her necessary needs for our International flight and due to inconsistencies they told her that she would not be able to bring her bag on the flight and that it needed to be checked since bin space was limited (we saw people place take three personal bags onto the plane and place into the bins above). When asked if she would see her bag in DC they told her no and that she would only see it when we landed in Croatia. We had 2 destinations (DC and Zurich) that we would be landing at before then which was a total time frame of around 16 hours. Due to this my wife was unable to keep many of her things that she needed for the long flight. They allowed no wiggle room despite bins having space when we entered the plane nor did they provide us with advice, just kept telling us it would be seen in Croatia. Next issue was after we landed in DC and made it to our gate to Zurich, I walked up to the front desk (since we were on our honeymoon) to ask if there were any upgrades available. The very rude lady at the desk laughed in my face causing others to look at me and told me that \"We haven't done that since the 70's and even if we did, everyone would be on their honeymoon! It's a full flight and you can go sit down now\" She never looked at her computer nor did she apologize for nothing being available. Lastly on our 9 hour flight from DC to Zurich, being in the premium economy class, the TVs did not even work on the flight and we were told to watch from our devices and we were never given a choice for a dinner meal (the vegetarian meal) because they ran out of the meat meal and were never offered an apology or even given something extra to make up for the deficiency.

I'm stuck in a tiny ball in the window seat with arthritis in my back. This is going to be a brutal flight. They were already subpar by my standards, but they were the only option.

Lack of customer service at the airport caused further nightmares. We prepaid for all our checked luggage for going on our trip and coming back, however, it took an assistant at each airport to key in secret codes while getting boarding passes because the prepaid amounts did not show in their system.

We finally made it to Newark. We went to the gate to be told they don\u2019t have a pilot and that they hope that they will have one soon. After an hour delay the pilot showed up and we were on our way.

I\u2019ll do my best not to fly with United ever again. This airline is a catastrophe! The staff are shockingly disrespectful, unprofessional, and useless, taking pleasure in having \u2018power\u2019 over the passengers who are supposed to shut up and follow every absurd order without hesitation. They made me feel like a convict rather than a customer who paid for their services. My daughter and I made the mistake of flying with United from Newark, NJ, to Munich. It was a disaster right from the start. During online check-in I realized that you couldn\u2019t choose your seat. My daughter and I were conveniently assigned two seats in the middle of a 4-seat row. The only way to get out was to pay extra, and not too little. This is pure blackmail! I already paid heftily for our tickets and simply couldn\u2019t afford to pay more. Nor did I expect to. I guess I'm spoiled. Problems and tension continued on the ground. When we were checking in our bags, a United employee in charge couldn\u2019t answer a single question we had and just grumpily pointed her finger at the check-in kiosk. It appeared that she couldn\u2019t speak English at all and had no clue about the check-in process. Boarding was performed in the \u2018Meet the Parents\u2019 style, with group numbers and very strict rules on who goes where, how and when. When our group was finally called, the passengers were told to form 2 lines. One of them was going faster and I had the audacity to switch to it. That was a huge offense to the supervising employee (who actually did nothing at all before he noticed me and didn\u2019t care that there were 4 people in one line and 40 in the other one). He forced me back into the initial line and, to teach me a lesson, invited 5-7 people ahead of me to switch to the shorter line. I asked him if this was really necessary because I ended up ahead of them thanks to his \u2018lesson\u2019. He just snarled at me and withdrew with a job-well-done air. Right before the airplane door, they suddenly forced us to check in our carry-ons (that United allows on international flights), claiming that there was no more room on the plane. I told them that our bags were quite small and that we had a very tight connection in Munich. Should our carry-ons be lost, we\u2019d have no basic stuff to survive for a couple of days. But that didn\u2019t convince them. What\u2019s worse, they didn\u2019t give us any time to remove our valuables from the carry-ons. We had to decide within seconds, on the floor right in front of the plane door and under unkind supervision of boarding personnel. As I was franticly going through my carry-on to salvage my computer, an employee yelled at me \u2018You wanna fly? Gimme that bag!\u2019 Some service. Our carry-ons did make it to Munich. However, ALL of my underwear (used and new) was missing from mine. This is the craziest thing I have ever experienced! And I have no illusions about reimbursement.

It\u2019s not an option. It should be. So, the wife and I took an amazing week long vacation to Cabo. Our airline of choice for the trip was American Airlines. We got to Cabo with no problems, on time and had excellent service from American. The vacation was awesome. Everything was great with our trip until we got to the airport for our return trip home. Due to weather, we could fly American from Cabo to Dallas/Fort Worth but would have to stay the night because our return flight to Cincinnati was cancelled. The ticket agent said we could fly out on an earlier United Airlines flight to Houston, have a longer lay over and get home later than planned, but we would get home by midnight. We decided to go with United. Big mistake. Initially when we checked in for American, we pre-paid our checked bags. American wasn\u2019t set up to refund our pre-paid checked bags, we were flying another airline, so I get having to pay for checked bags again for United, but it still peeved my off. Although we had boarding passes printed by American, we were directed to the automated kiosk to check in for United. We did. Then we went to the counter. They did the same thing we did in the automated kiosk. Exactly the same things. This slowed us up and we had to rush to make the flight. We made it in the nick of time to  United Airlines counter staff. The flight to Houston was notable in the fact the we sat in the very last row of the plan and had listen to the cabin crew gripe about the flight crew and United Airlines in general. Service was sub-par. That\u2019s the reason I hate to fly United, no one is happy that works for them. No one. Upon arrival to Houston, we found that a corner of my wife\u2019s check on bag was broken off and a wheel was missing. The baggage person didn\u2019t care and said we could not do anything about it there and would have to file a claim at our final destination. Once we cleared the baggage check we found out our flight to Cincinnati had been canceled. Figuring we were going have to overnight in Houston we tried to retrieve our bags but were told that we could get them there. Linearly, the bags at this point were right past the entrance to the conveyer belt. We were told we would have to wait to get our bags until our cancelled flights departure time and even then, it would take a while. We were then directed to out departure gate tof our cancelled flight. The staff at the gate stated the flight had been cancelled due to staffing, gave us a QR code to rebook a flight home or go to customer service for help. We walked to the United Airlines customer service area and joined the 400 people already in-line waiting. While waiting 4-plus hours in the line I called the customer service line on the QR code and found I could fly out of Houston, to Cincinnati, 24-hours later or fly to Louisville tonight. Louisville is an hour and a half drive from Cincinnati and we had no way to get to Cincinnati from Louisville. Apparently no \u201cweather\u201d issues to Louisville but to Cincinnati \u201cweather\u201d issues. We rebooked our flight 24-hours later and were told to go to customer serviced for boarding passes and vouchers for hotel rooms in Houston.

It was a pain in the butt to try to get my bag back the next day, but because they knew where it was, it was able to be done. Everyone I talked to both on the United and Air Canada side could not give me any information along the way and it was never scanned or documented. But at the end of the day I got my bag back. Now on the way back, I had a connecting flight in Vancouver, and there was a plane delay. That happens all the time - I travel for work so I'm constantly on planes, and the delays do not bother me. This delay however caused me to miss my connection, so I had to be rebooked from Vancouver to Chicago with another connecting flight through Denver. I triple asked and was reassured that my bag would follow me to Chicago and that they would reroute it. I was not allowed to pass customs until my bag was confirmed in Vancouver, so I know it at least made it to Vancouver. When I got to Chicago (at 2:00 a.m. the next day instead of the 8:00 p.m. the previous day as I was expecting), it was clear that my bag could not made it with me. I submitted a file reference number, and was told my bag would get to me either tomorrow or the next day. The things in my bag are for work, so I need them to do my job and I am at a major disadvantage not having them. Since then, I called on Saturday as well as multiple times on Sunday and now it is Monday and I've called three or four times today as well. I almost never leave reviews and I almost never call as much as I have, but my confidence in their ability to get my bag back as extremely low. Every single person I've talked to (And I've talked to people in both United and Air Canada) has first said that they don't know where the bag is and then after I insist that it made it to Vancouver, they put me on a hold and then come back and confirm that it is definitely in Vancouver and they just need to have it released by Air Canada. Everyone I've talked to has been very polite, but nothing has really been helpful in getting my bag back. They've said that they need to contact Air Canada to get them to release the bag to send to Chicago. I have now been told this four times. Two of those four times they put me on a hold to contact Vancouver and then came back maybe 3 minutes later to say they couldn't get a hold of anyone so they'll message them to release the bag. The only flight to Chicago leaving Vancouver is in 2 hours from now and I'm not very confident that my bag will make it on that flight which means I'm going to be SOL for work tomorrow. My bag is literally just sitting there in Vancouver and no one can seem to figure out how to get it on a plane. It's located, we know where it is, we know how to get it back to me, but it's just not happening. I recognize that United is trying to get back on their feet after the craziness of the last few years and they have limited staff. And I totally emphasize with that. On the other hand, it should be an easy interaction to figure this out and it wouldn't take very long. No one can seem to explain to me why it's an issue to take 3 days to get Air Canada to release the bag (And I'm not even very confident that that is the issue, since after talking to Air Canada that doesn't seem to be the problem) to send to Chicago, and still no end in sight.

Unfortunately, \"10-15 minutes more\" became the anthem for the next four hours while we remained in the plane or wandering the tarmac, hoping that finally we could go home. At around 3:30 pm, they finally informed us that it was certain that the flight was canceled and the next flight would only go out at 11:15 am the next morning. This meant that we lost a whole day to this United mishap, which posed a problem for us as I, alongside my wife, had work the next day because of prior commitments that we couldn't take off more time for. This cost us an entire day of income and it is already difficult to organize a trip together due to the fact that we have two daughters in college with different schedules. After deplaning and taking out all of hand-carry luggage, we were made to wait 1 extra hour just for our luggage, which never even left Paris as we never did, to come. Then, we waited in line for another few hours to receive our new boarding passes and information for the hotel where they would put us up. They also expected us to use the airport shuttle that stopped relatively far from the hotels when most of the passengers on the flight had a lot of luggage that we were made to drag and walk with by ourselves. We ended up having to pay for a taxi to take us to and from the hotel because it would have taken us even longer and would have been quite a hassle. By the time that we left the airport, we had been there for approximately 11 hours (from 8 am to 7 pm) and had wasted the entire \"extra\" day in Paris because of United's troubles. The next day, luckily check-in was relatively easy, but when boarding was delayed because catering came late, and they began to say \"just 10-15 minutes more\", I really thought that this was it, we were going to get a canceled flight again. After all, that's how it started the day before. Luckily, we were able to board the plane starting 11:10 am (flight was supposed to lift off at 11:15 am), which caused approximately a 30 minute, which honestly was fine considering everything else that happened. The rest of the grievances are minor in comparison, but after the complete shit show that United puts on every time we fly with them, it's important to include. There is usually a 50/50 chance that the charging port at your seat doesn't work and for a longer international flight, this can be quite annoying. A flight attendant also questioned my identity and asked to see my passport because I was shown as \"missing\" even though another employee had been the one to scan my boarding pass and I had gone through the several (maybe even useless?) clearances required in the Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. In addition, after asking for an ice cream after the flight attendant handed out ice creams to everyone but me, the flight attendant proceeded to point toward my stomach and said mockingly that he thought I was trying to lose weight. Now, I understand that he was trying to make a joke, but after the United shit show, I wasn't really in the mood and I think being strangers, that comment was just very strange and rude. Overall, flying with United is a terrible experience and I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you want things to go wrong."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "August 2022", "review": "\u2705 Trip Verified |  Not for families.

My brother in law respectfully said no and the flight attendant with her manger proceeded to look at the footage on his device to make sure there wasn\u2019t a recording.

When I discovered the flight change 3 months later they refused to deal with me, even though I was the passenger, and would only talk to my travel agent. They failed to notify me that they changed my flight to something unfeasible. 52 minutes to change flights at O\u2019Hare? Eventually, I was able to get it changed. The two passengers in my row for my transatlantic flight were a 6-hour & 15-minute nightmare. I sat next to a big man who used my leg space, even to the point of touching my leg with his the entire night. I never slept. His continuous loud yawns and his arm and elbow into my seat space didn\u2019t help. Next to him was a younger guy who appeared to be sick. I thought he was going to throw up, but he just burped/hiccuped very loudly for most of the flight. The flight attendants had to constantly ask him to move his legs and feet, which wasn't easy, especially when they repeatedly had trouble waking him when they tried to move the cart down the aisle. Why didn\u2019t the flight attendants notice either passenger and do something? Months before departure I called United with my request for vegetarian fare. Incredulously, the flight attendants asked every passenger if they wanted the cheeseburger or veggie burger on the return flight so that, by the time they got to me, there was only one left. When I told the flight attendant I had preordered, she replied, coldly, \u201cThere\u2019s no pre-ordering.\u201d If this is true, why does United offer the ability to do so? The guy behind me was not as fortunate as I. Despite having pre-ordered, they had no vegetarian meals left. Needless to say, he was very upset as he ended up not eating. Why was this allowed to happen? What is the purpose of enabling you to request a dietary choice in advance if it will not be honored, especially after everyone else on the plane is given a choice that ultimately exhausts the supply of that which you ordered? Flight from Newark to San Diego--I had to endure a screaming, crying baby, which began before the flight began and lasted for the entire flight. Every few minutes throughout the flight, this baby/toddler would let out with a high-pitched scream that was painful. Never mind why the parents would inflict this torture on fellow passengers\u2014why would United Airlines? Why didn\u2019t United take action? This 6-hour & 55-minutes was pure torture. Again, United personnel looked the other way. I tore my used anti-bacterial wipe to stuff in each ear. It might have helped a little, but the pieces of paper were not earplugs, so I spent most of the long flight holding them pushed into my ears with my fingers. On the same flight, there was a rude stewardess. She chose to ignore me instead of answering my question when I asked her where she was going with my bag that I had stowed over my row before I sat. For some reason, she moved it down the aisle. Would it have been so difficult to reply when I asked her calmly where she was taking it? Instead, she just gave me an unfriendly look and continued. When the plane was in the air, the cart moved down the aisle to offer drinks, she and another stewardess decided not to offer me a drink, even though they gave them to the people sitting next to me.

My vacation to Hawaii was tainted by this experience, and I will never fly with this airline again.

Around hour 10, United decided to pass out free waters and snacks; these were expired granola bars and fruit snacks.  Finally, we thought there was hope when the Captain of the aircraft came and made a grand speech about how he\u2019ll get to our destination for sure that evening. He even received a standing ovation and cheers. We still waited 2 additional hours after that. Then when we finally were able to board the plane, the stewardess threatened all the passengers saying that if we do not board under a certain amount of time, we would not be able to fly out to Hawaii. This is when I knew we were never getting out of there. All 300 passengers worked together to quickly board the plane. The plane just taxied for a half hour around the runway and made an abrupt announcement that his staff could unboard. Then, the captain lectured the passengers that we essentially ran out of time and could not fly. We were all held in the plane for another thirty minutes until we could unboard. They would not let us exit because the customer service line was already way too long. Apparently there were more United flights that had issues. When we finally were released, there was a massive line at customer service. Workers did not know what was going on, and lied and said they ran out of hotel vouchers because they did not want to deal with the long line. Those who were lucky enough to receive some kind of voucher got hotel rooms (instead of cots they offered for use in the airport) and none of the meal vouchers worked. We were finally able to fly out to Maui the following morning; of course it was delayed by two hours. We had the same captain who completely changed his demeanor because management was around, but it did not fool any of the passengers.

I will start with airline itself which while bearing United Express is operated by Mesa which does flights as United Express up and down the east coast in the E175 and other aircrafts. When I was boarding the plane boarding was fairly easy and we were told ahead of time that there would be limited service and bags would most likely need to be checked on the aircraft as it was a full flight. I don't remember how many bags were checked but it was a lot. Upon boarding we were all given santaizing wipes, and boy did I need one for my particular seat 4A as it was not particularly clean on the windowshade, tray table, plastics, and air controls, why does everyone insist on putting their dirty fingers on everything? Anyways, the seats around me were cleaner by the looks of it. I was just unlucky and I couldn't trade with another first class traveller as no one wanted to move. The seat featured a socket, an adjustable head rest, and a lot of padding (can't say the same for economy and I am glad I upgraded early on as the flight filled last second.) The seat was quite comfortable with a lot of pitch and recline for a regional jet. Enough about the seat, lets move on to service. Initially, we were told there would be no service, however more on that In a bit. On the ground we started off with orange juice and water as well as the complimentary COVID bags United is still giving out with Pretzels, Nuts, a stroopwafel, and water. Unfortunately, the flight attendant in the front managed to spill some orange juice on the tray she was serving from and the plastic cups were wet at the bottom, I really shouldn't have taken the water as it dripped on me and the drink holder that was also attached to the seat. She did apologize about that as the previous crew had managed to shove things into the compartments making it impossible not to spill. She then afterwards proceeded with the safety briefing and collected the trash before we took off. Once in the air service did improve for First as she had to delay the in-flight service a bit due to the captain thinking there would be more turbulence than there actually was, again more on that in a bit. She managed to serve first class with both alcoholic beverages and regular ones as usual, however she referred to everyone by our names, guess it was passed along somehow. Very professional. Economy However, did not get service as the periods of high turbulence made serving 68 people impossible as soon as she started she had to sit down. So anyways. I managed to get through my flight looking at the in-flight map as well as looking at movies and shows to watch.

The flights from Jacksonville to Chicago and from D.C. to Jacksonville were great, and the meal box my dad and I shared from Jacksonville to Chicago was delicious. The flights from Chicago to St. Louis and from St. Louis to D.C. were unfortunately more lackluster compared to the prior two. This is really only because the seats on the planes they were on were tiny and my dad and I were squished together like sardines despite the seating being in a 2-2 configuration. To give you an idea of how small the seats were, I\u2019ll tell you this. My dad and I are both \u201cbigger\u201d if you know what I mean, my dad being bigger than me. On the planes my dad couldn\u2019t buckle his seatbelt all the way due to his size and he needed a seatbelt extender. Now despite him being a bigger person, he\u2019s never had an issue with seatbelts fitting him on airplanes and he has flown quite a bit in his life. I\u2019m a decent bit smaller than he is and even I had to squeeze a bit to fit in the seatbelt, and beyond that the seats were just uncomfortable in general. Now the planes for these flights were operated by a regional airline so naturally they were smaller. I\u2019ve since checked United\u2019s fleet and I\u2019m pretty certain that both of the planes were CRJ 550s. However everything else about these flights were great and the first flights I mentioned were on bigger jets so the seats were much more comfortable. The flight crew was polite and attentive and once again the food on the flight from Jacksonville to Chicago was great! Another positive was when we got off the plane at D.C., we had to come off the plane using the stairs not the \u201ctunnel\u201d (I don\u2019t know the technical term) for some reason. I have a fear of falling down stairs and these were really steep. The ground crew was very kind and helpful in helping me get down.

Panicked, I provided another card and it was also \"not accepted\".

I informed the agent of the situation and provided confirmation numbers, and requested a supervisor be party to the ongoing tortured experience. They complied and the supervisor canceled the original reservation and created another stating she had upgraded me to economy plus at no extra cost. My original reservation was upgraded to economy plus at my request as I wanted checked bags and early boarding at a net price of $1000.00 after credits applied. The new reservation was about the same. Curious, at no extra cost?

What sort of safety measures is this company taking pre take off if someone only noticed a flight leak this late in the game? We sat on the plane for another hour waiting for the fuel leak to be investigated and eventually we were sent back to the airport. By this time it was 1am. We lined up waiting to speak to United staff to obtain more information however the queues were barely moving. By 2am I decided to get my hold luggage and leave. We were told the incorrect information 3 times by United officials with regards to where to collect our bags. I eventually asked a cleaner who kindly took me to the right place. We were also told to collect hotel vouchers from the United attendants at the baggage hall however they denied all knowledge of this and sent us back upstairs. It was a complete shambles. 3am and I eventually lost my temper having already taken 3 flights to get to San Francisco. I was eventually given a hotel voucher. The next day I checked the United app to see whether there was advice with regards to how to refund the flight cost. I discovered that United had booked me on a flight from San Francisco to Frankfurt to Singapore and they had not communicated this to me via email, text or in person. I cancelled the flight and was offered a refund for the original flight cost. I agreed to this and then an error stating the refund could not be processed popped up. I booked another flight with Singapore Air when the United flight was cancelled, and arrived at the airport 2 days after my original flight to discuss my flight refund with United staff in person. I waited for an hour at the United counter whilst employees tried to figure out if they could refund me (one would think this is a regular occurrence). Eventually they told me I have to do it online (even though sometimes they can do it person) as well as claim for all the food I ate while I was stuck in San Francisco and the difference between my original United flight ticket cost and the new Singapore Airlines ticket price (more expensive because of demand and short notice). I claimed online and was told I would not be reimbursed for any of the food costs incurred, or the taxi from airport to the airport hotel, or the difference between the United Airlines flight and the Singapore Air flight. United gave me a refund for the cancelled flight and a United Airlines voucher (which I will clearly never use!) I asked for cash refund instead, they said they \"don't do this\". The service from United was absolutely dreadful. I do not know how any company operates like this but I will never fly United again. This delay has resulted in a multitude of extra costs for me at my next destination including a COVID test which is now 4 times more expensive than my original booking, money lost on a hotel, money to change my onward flight from my next destination.

In this most recent case, United once again made us late for our arrival to Calgary. Then, we had to wait over an hour to receive our baggage. By that point, the car I hired to drive me to my family 120 minutes away had left given they had other passengers, thus abandoning me in Calgary. Not surprisingly, United refused to help citing that once a passenger arrives at their final location, they no longer have to compensate for poor service. United\u2019s sub-par service on this flight alone cost me over $600 USD to take a taxi to meet my family at one AM. In aggregate, United does a fantastic job of financial damage control by refusing to compensate for their terrible service, thus ensuring a better financial bottom line for share holders, fully accepting the hit to their reputation. If you fly another airline such as Delta and then compare the experiences, sadly the disparity is massive, and United looks even worse.

One month before our travel plans I received a message saying our departing aircraft was returning to Boston a full day later than we had booked for. Our 4 hour flight was now turning into an overnighter and 14 hour trip with 3 connecting airplanes to catch. I had hotel and car reservations that I was paying for in Boston for the day we had planned for. I lost almost $1000 on these plans alone. I contacted United and spoke with a very nice woman who helped me use their customer service tool to request reimbursement for my \"significantly changed flight\". I was reimbursed my trip at the assurance that I was still booked for the flight (I asked the woman about this several times throughout our conversation). She assured me that because United could not book me on another flight because there were none scheduled, I was entitled to my money back for my flight because of significant unavoidable changes to our trip. After checking one final time that I was still in fact booked for my flight, we hung up and I received my refund a few weeks later. Fast forward to the last day of our trip. I call United because I did not see a check in option for my flight and now my confirmation code won't work. Come to find out the United representative cancelled my reservation and I was without a flight and stuck in Utah. I gave this agent everything I had: case numbers from customer service, the name of the original agent I spoke with, dates, emails and she did not care to acknowledge any of it. She said \"I am sorry the agent gave you false information but you must buy your ticket for tomorrow on this flight at current market value\". Not only was my flight canceled on me, they charged me $900 dollars for a flight I originally purchased at $400. I informed the woman that on their website it says that United will reimburse for \"significant travel delays\". The original agent I spoke with quoted a delay of 6 hours as a significant delay which mine ended up being 14 hours by the time all was said and done. This United supervisor did not care to hear any of it and several times in our conversation just stopped answering me. All she had to say is that United doesn't reimburse a flight if you still get on the flight, which is a complete lie. United's website WILL reimburse for travel delays while also allowing you to take the flight. So in all United cost me almost $2000 dollars in flights and missed rental and hotel reservations.

There was an hour delay, then the boarding process took forever, people from later groups cutting in front of the current group, it took forever to leave the runway, then we had to wait to land until there was a gate available, we kept circling the airport. By the time we landed in Newark, NJ our flight had already departed. There was no one at our gate to help us, we had to search the airport to find customer service. There was a LONG line once we reached it, with only 2 agents available. It was painfully slow. They kept telling us to use the QR code and/ or the kiosk, but we needed to speak with someone so continued to wait. A woman cut in front of the entire line and the female agent helped her anyway. The line was frustrated and angry and a man went up and told the agent that the woman had cut in front of everyone and that it wasn't fair and she needed to wait in line like everyone else. She continued to help her anyways, then left and went to go get another agent and they both continued to help this woman and make the rest of us wait. It was at least another 20 minutes of them helping her as though she was more important than the rest of us. It was unfair and frustrating to us all. We were in line for an hour or so before we finally made it to the front of the line. Hours later saw the same woman who had cut in front of the line sitting at her gate so obviously she wasn't in dire need of immediate help. 6 hours later we finally were able to get a flight.

They had no idea they were sending our bags to different locations! How does that happen when they check you in with your id\u2019s! After pointing that out to the rep, she had to redo everything and recall our bags.

Apparently several flights were scheduled to leave Omaha then and there was a bottleneck at the TSA. We made it and boarded our flight at 5:45. At 6:00, it was announced that we were holding the plane for 30 people stuck in security. Reasonable , but it created a smaller window for making our connection in Denver. There was then a mechanical delay and we left Omaha with a targeted arrival in Denver of 15 minutes before our departure time to Portland. I spoke to a flight attendant once in the air and expressed my concern about missing a connection. She found that 17 people on our flight were booked on the same flight to Portland. She said we may have to run, but typically when there are than many people potentially missing a connection, that they will hold a flight for a few minutes. Not completely reassuring, but I appreciate the attempt. There was mention of a cart at the gate, but this did not develop. We landed and deplaned 14 minutes before our connection was supposed to depart. I sprinted from our arrival gate to the connection departure gate and arrive as the first of 17 at 7:43, seven minutes before scheduled departure time. Our plane was still connected to the jetway and luggage was still being loaded, but the door had been closed. The agent at the gate said she was instructed to close the door and it could not be reopened. I made it clear that 16 other people with similar concerns were soon to arrive at the gate. She said it was not her choice to close the door and there was nothing that could be done. We were instructed to go see customer service and the agent left the gate. We went to customer service and that was disaster. Short version is that we had an overwhelmed agent book us on to a flight 13 hours later; while she slowly does this and adds us to a standby list for a 10:50 AM flight, three others from my flight get on standby before my wife and I. My wife is a rewards member so she goes to the top of the list, but I stay at 5 for a full flight. Wonder what will happen? We are given $10 food vouchers for our inconvenience, which do not cover a sandwich. While waiting for the 10:50, I see a United advertisement stating they are #1 in on time departures for five years in a row. I now understand why. At 10:40 when the doors are supposed to close, the flight has ten open seats due to late connections. Instead of giving the seats to standby passengers and closing the door like they did with our earlier flight, they announce that they are holding the flight for 10 minutes. Then a second agent shows up who starts to argue about closing the door. She sends the first agent away. At 10:48, she panics and calls up the first stand by (my wife) who scrambles to get a boarding pass and boards. There is one seat left at 10:49. I push for it, she yells at me as she prints a pass, and then a booked passenger shows up, takes my place, and the family is split. On my way back to customer service, I spot a Skywest to Eugene (100 miles from Portland). I hustle to the gate and try to board. The agent is great and I board to Eugene knowing I have to figure out a way home from there. I emailed this and more to United and they gave us a $75 credit. Not enough.

They were kind, friendly, helpful, informative and basically every trait you would want in a flight attendant and human being!

A few weeks ago I traveled in United's Polaris Class from SFO to London (LHR) with two other members of my family. When booking the flights, the booking agents confirmed I would be in the new Polaris product with the Suites.  The outbound flight used United's old business class cabin which hadn't changed layout and seats (with the exception of some nice amenities). On the return flight, the plane had the new Polaris cabin which was great. United flies the 787-9 on this route. Many of these aircraft have not been updated to the new Polaris cabin. You can check if you are on the new product by looking at the seat map. If the cabin has four seats across you are in the new Polaris cabin. If there are six seats, you have the old business class product. Both ways the service was great from the flight attendants, though there was no personalized greeting once the flight was underway (an easy fix). The food was the worst I have seen across 20+ years of traveling in business class especially when spending almost $9000 in tickets. As an example, on the way back for the pre arrival meal, they served what was called \"hamburger wellington\" a dry hamburger with processed cheese and some kind of bread or pastry around it (see picture). Dinner was disappointing. I chose the beef which was over cooked and bore little similarity to what was described on the menu. Desert was a small tub of ice cream. The cabin staff who served seemed embarrassed and apologetic when I brought up the food quality suggesting cost cuts and COVID. There was no other food served during the flight between the 2 main meals so we went hungry. In summary, if you fly out of the US internationally and your equipment is a 797-9, you may not fly in the new cabin with the suites. It seems like the booking agents are unaware of the difference between the two business class products and you may be told you are flying in the new suites when you are not.

She said it was her seat and I did not want any friction to happen because of this. So I got up and I told her I would try and figure out what is going on. As I told the flight attendant, she responded with \"Well you shouldn't have gotten up. I don't know what to tell you.\" I was completely shocked. I love United and I fly your airline over any whenever I can. She asked me to step in the back, so I did. I asked what was going on and how this could be fixed. The same flight attendant then said \"I don't have time for this, or you. I am not even supposed to be working on this flight.\" This conversation really upset me. And it was heard by many travelers. Another flight attendant looked at my ticket and said, \"Look, your seat was changed, look at your ticket.\" And she was right. I apologized. Whenever my flight has changed with United, I was told by the professional who gave me my boarding pass to get on the plane. So, I switched to 8D. I went to the seat and the entire row was booked. My anxiety started rising and I felt very uncomfortable on your airline flight. I was spoken down to and disrespected. I made a mistake with the seat. I should have been extra cautious and looked but I didn't because everything seemed perfect until I got on. I told a flight attendant and I was told to look at the empty seats and sit somewhere. Is that how they should respond? As an experienced individual with a mental health diagnosis, I find it so important to always be careful who you speak to with a bad tone.  And flight attendants deserve the same respect. If I had an anxiety attack, I could have been taken off the plane due to health reasons and stuck alone and honestly really scared. My bag was in 20D above and I was maybe at 7 window I believe. I honestly didn't even look. I was just happy to have been able to sit down.

I have experienced a trend with United that I have not experienced with any of the other carriers (including discount Allegiant). I would estimate that 35-40% of the United flights I have bought for the last 10 years have been delayed or canceled. Several times, this has resulted in an inconvenience. For example, my current experience is this: my return flight from Gillette, Wyoming to Denver was delayed by 2 hours. I received two texts that informed me that it had been delayed further. When u finally got to Denver, I had missed my connection flight to Nashville. After I de-planed, I spoke to the attendant at the flight desk. When I asked, he stated that the plane had been delayed due to maintenance and instructed me to go to the customer service desk to get my flight rescheduled and get hotel accommodations. When I did, I was informed by the customer service Manager that they couldn't do anything to help with my hotel. He stated that flight had been delayed by almost 2 hours due to the FAA air traffic control department. I asked him what that meant. He only vaguely explained and reiterated that United Airlines could not help with my hotel room.

I found a flight at 10:00. I approached customer service to inquire about that flight. They informed me that flight had been delayed TOO. Therefore, my flight from Gillette to Denver was delayed and rescheduled for the next day. Then, that flight was delayed for over 4 hours. In addition, the two other flight to Nashville were also delayed. In addition to all this, I was beside a guy in the customer service line that had 3 flights delayed in one day.

However, we had an outstanding crew that did their best with the limited resources United gave them in a totally packed flight.

Even worse on the 15+ hour JNB-EWR service with a coach-like tray dinner, meager breakfast and not a snack in between. Flight attendants on both UA legs were pleasant enough but certainly not in any way attentive. Just matter-of-fact doing-my-job.

I would have to guess that a $31 per person to catch a bus back to Milwaukee would be cheaper then competing us a hotel room, shuttle, food vouchers and another flight back to Milwaukee.

While the flight attendant was about to go over the safety card for the flight, the pilot told us there was no one to receive us in STL because everyone at the STL airport went home. At about 1am our flight was finally cancelled. After waiting in line at customer service to get a new flight for about an hour, I was told that if I booked a Southwest flight, I would be reimbursed for the United flight back to STL and the Southwest flight to STL. My cousin and I had to get on that early Southwest flight in the morning because I had final exams that week and he had work the night day and a United had no other flights until half way through the day.

We spent time at O'Hare's United Club in Terminal 1 after transferring from Terminal 5 International arrival and stayed there for a couple hours waiting for our flight. The gate to our flight is just a few doors down from the lounge so we waited until boarding time before we leave the lounge. Boarding was done very orderly, First Class were called first then Economy were called by rows from back to front. Interesting concept of preventing Covid-19 transmission in this single aisle plane, letting First Class passengers get exposed to all Economy passengers passing them on their way to the back of the plane. Had this been a widebody this concept might work if Economy passengers entering from the second door, bypassing the First/Business Class passengers up front. It's obvious we are on an American carrier from the very tight pitch of seats, very different from Asian carriers we used in the past few weeks. The plane was clean even though it is kind of old (19 years - registration N37267). We used Clorox wipes to sanitize the tray table, armrest, seatbelts and screen when we got to our seat. We're back in the US so this is very important and it is something we have to do to keep ourselves safe! Movies and TV series from United's inflight entertainment program is enough for this short (2 hours) flight. I lost my wireless transmitter while transferring in Chicago O'Hare so I have to use one of the free headphones given by the FAs. The FAs on this plane are two older gentlemen and two older ladies. They were all very lovely, very laid back, helpful and cheerful. From how they help and interact with their passengers you can tell that they like their job. One of the FAs was even cracking jokes when she was making pre-departure announcement. I'd take them in a heartbeat over 95% of all other UA FA's that I have met in the past! The FAs were also very nice and approachable. They were open to chit chat when I was standing in the back galley stretching while waiting for a restroom. We were given sanitizing wipes when we were boarding, and a goodie bag with pretzels, stroopwafel and a small water bottle after take off. Then the FAs making rounds with the drink cart midway through the flight. We left 10 minutes behind schedule but arrived at 8.25 pm, around 34 minutes earlier than scheduled. Deplaning was done quick and very orderly, the FAs calling the rows to stand up to pick up our carry on and deplane while others behind were asked to stay seated, so there was no rushing or a line to deplane. It was an uneventful flight but the FA's cheerful and helpful disposition gives a good impression about United that they are improving their service.

Our flight from IAH arrived early so we have enough time to transfer. When we arrived at the boarding lounge the gate agents made us line up and check our travel documents before we were told we can take a seat. The process was slow and very ineffective; there are 5 gate agents but seems only 2 out of 5 agents know what to do since the other 3 older ladies always have to call and refer with the two guys for each and every passenger they are working with! Boarding was done from back to front and they call passengers by row so there is no crowding around the gate. Mask is to be worn at all times in the boarding area and during the flight except when eating and drinking.

The kid was young and wasn't too experienced so initially he was kind of gruff; but after a while he warms up and even wishes us a safe trip.

I bought a business-class flat bed ticket on United 363 from Newark to Honolulu leaving on 12/17/2020 at 9:50am. I required a business class level of service due to my injured spine with multiple herniated discs. Due to the snowstorm on the night of 12/16-12/17, I had difficulty finding a taxi and getting to the airport, and I arrived at the airport 50 minutes prior to my 9:40am departure. I had already checked in to my flight online and just needed to drop off 1 bag, which is technically still within United's 45-minute window submitting luggage for domestic flights. However, when I inquired about business class service, United personnel had no idea where to direct me. At first they sent me from the 2nd to the 3rd level of Newark Terminal C, however the United personnel there claimed they don't service Hawaii and sent me back down to Level 2, which was all Economy and big lines. I tried approaching multiple United personnel and all of them refused to help me and directed me towards Economy lines. Soon, they claimed I was too late for my flight - but I wouldn't be late if they did their job from the beginning and assisted me with priority service! At this point I was sent to wait in a massive line for customer assistance (again, no business class service to be found). I would have missed every other UA flight waiting in that line, but I also called United customer service by phone, where United phone agent (the only helpful agent in this entire experience) helped me rebook for a flight that departed one hour later, at 10:50am with a connection in SFO. However, I was made to pay a $539 flight upgrade fee that was sold to me as an \"upgrade\" from business to 1st class, which in reality turned out to be exactly the opposite, a downgrade: an old upright seat with minimal recline that is vastly inferior to my previously booked flat bed business seat, and much worse for my back. I found this deeply unfair. Even after rebooking, checking in to my new First Class flight was again a nightmare and I almost missed it, too, with no one willing to assist me even as I followed the phone agent's advice and told United personnel that I was flying 1st class. Probably 5 or 6 employees shooed me away and told me to get into a line for Economy electronic kiosks (half of which weren't working) and a long Economy passenger line for bag drop-off. The computer kiosk (when I finally got to it) again claimed I was too late to register baggage for my newly re-booked flight, but I miraculously found one competent UA agent who helped me overcome this. All in all, I had an absolute worst nightmare flying experience of my life. The physical pain in my back flared up from all of the dashing between floors, kiosks, and lines that I was made to endure with no one able or willing to help me. The service I received from United was absolutely abominable and especially so for business/1st class, and frankly it was horrible for any human being in any class to be subjected to such humiliation, physical pain, and monetary deprivation (which was unreasonable because I was actually downgraded, not upgraded). Online complaint with UA resulted in a generic \"you were late and we won't do anything\" answer (arriving 50 minutes should have absolutely been accommodated for a business class traveler who already checked in).

The booking process went smoothly. The flight was a typical United flight - uncomfortable on an airplane the belonged in 1986. The issue came when I went to the rental car counter - I showed them my reservation and they did not have it. They claimed that I booked my reservation for the non-airport location. I had to bring up my email confirmation that proved otherwise. This caused a stir at the counter as they weren\u2019t sure they would have a car for me. Mind you, it was about 8PM at night, and I had a 2-hour car ride to look forward to. Coupled with the aforementioned terrible flight, I wasn\u2019t in the mood to be told there was no car availability when I had a reservation. I was able to get a car, but I had to pay extra due to the reservation \u201cmixup\u201d (if you can call it that). I filed a complaint with United Airlines and Dollar UA. United and Dollar UA accused me of changing my reservation to the non-airport car rental location, despite my email confirmation as proof that I did no such thing and chose the airport location to begin with. Both companies ignored several follow-ups and pleas to look at my case. In fact, at one point, they were pointing fingers at each other, trying to send me running in circles. I even emailed the CEO and COO of United and of course, heard crickets. The extreme amount of disrespect, disregard for human nature, and overall extremely poor customer service sickened me. I escalated matters to BBB. BBB did not resolve my case. BBB ignored my email confirmation that I booked for the airport pick-up location and sided with Dollar and United. It was extremely frustrating that I was being ignored for booking a car online and choosing the location that I intended. I did everything right in my reservation process. United and Dollar were both at fault and it was obvious they simply do not care about their customer. They stole from me, and then tried to make me look like the bad guy for their egregious and obvious error. Their lack of accountability and sheer unprofessional behavior drove me to continue pushing the matter. My initial escalation in this matter started at the beginning of January 2020. It is mid-June and it is just being resolved now. It has taken 2 months of escalations to come to a resolution, after me getting nowhere by myself for 4 months. It is a long saga that I am happy is now over. Will I ever fly United again, or book with Dollar UA? Absolutely not, and as a consumer reading this, I hope you don\u2019t either. Their unprofessionalism and lack of customer service (while they operate in a customer service industry) is simply shocking.

The next day we couldn't get back through security because our boarding passes didn't match the airport since we were rerouted and once we were finally through and out on the runway the flight was delayed again for technical issues. My wife and I finally just rented a car and drove home but now United refuses to reimburse us for the car rental. They gave us a $150 United credit which doesn't come close to covering the $500 flight that never even got us home, much less the car rental and the extra day we both missed work.

Who came up with this seat design and has anyone at United actually tried to use these seats? 2. Baggage hassles including incredibly restrictive carry on policies and \"nickel and dime\" fees. The worst is a requirement to pay a bag fee in order to check in and receive a boarding pass for some customer classes, regardless of whether or not the traveller actually has luggage. On my last 3 flights, my only luggage was a small personal item that I did not plan to check (a backpack), but I had to pay a checked bag fee in order to check-in for my flights. 3. frequent delays, over-bookings, etc and policies that make it difficult (and sometimes impossible) to change flights."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "February 2020", "review": "Not Verified |  New York to Chicago.

This was even more-so on the way back at DEN. I'm on the aircraft sitting in my tiny first-class seat. The pilot comes over the intercom and announces that because it is snowing at the United hub in Denver,(who'd of guessed Denver would do that?), some of our bags would not be going with us on this flight. Apparently, the airplane United uses to fly non-stop from JAX to DEN, (Embraer something-something), cannot carry the baggage that United promised to carry when they advertised non-stop service from JAX to DEN when it is snowing in DEN. Where United has a hub. They sell tickets for non-stop service from JAX to DEN, but they can't carry the baggage. So, whose bags do you think they select for non-service on this flight? If you guessed first class passengers who bought their tickets with money, you guessed correctly!  In thanks for buying the most expensive ticket on the plane, United rewards you with leaving your bag in Jacksonville! Who wouldn't want to fly United again after that? Then, during the flight from JAX to DEN (sans luggage), they serve what we shall call for lack of alternative terminology, \"breakfast.\" It is, and I quote the first-class flight attendant as she described it to the passenger seated in front of me, \"shelf-stable cheese product.\"  I'm not sure, because, while first-class (did I mention this comedy takes place entirely in first-class?) flight attendant offered this shelf-stable cheese product breakfast to all of my first-class companion passengers, she never actually offered it, or anything else, to me. I was ignored throughout the flight. But I did get to listen to the gossip between the economy class flight attendant and the first-class flight attendant for about an hour and half of the flight, covering topics from dating experiences to career aspirations or lack thereof. So, I land in Denver, intending to head into the mountains, without the contents of the suitcase I assumed (first-class ticket, non-stop flight to the airline's hub airport) would have arrived with me on my flight. Examples of missing items: boots, crampons, poles, ski jacket, underwear, so on and so forth. The check-in at Denver for the flight back was even worse, but the fight itself much better. No complaints with the DEN to JAX crew on the plane. But the JAX to DEN crew were depressingly lame. When I was younger, I used to travel on Greyhound and Trailways bus lines.

My experience started when I checked in online the night before. I started to check in and received an email that I was only allowed a personal item and had to check any carry-on luggage. Although I believe a carry-on should be a standard accommodation I figured I would just do it when I got to the airport since the one I was flying out of is not very busy. I was very disappointing to find out that you must check your carry-on when you check in online or you are denied checking in until at the gate. To avoid bad seating I just did it online and payed the $30. When I got to the gate, things started to go south again. The crew was rude and not very accommodating. None of them smiled. The flight (end of December) was delayed because they had to de-ice the plane which is okay. To not get the fumes of the de-icer in the plane, they turned off the air conditioning so things got stuffy and hot real quick. The plane did not return below 80 degrees for the rest of the flight.  I also happened to be in the row of seats that don't recline at all because of the emergency exits but the person in front of me did recline. So on my overnight flight I did not get any sleep because the conditions were so uncomfortable. During the flight, there was \"bad turbulence\" which was really actually mild so the crew did not provide the normal in-flight service. Because it took so long to de-ice the plane, I almost missed my connecting flight. Now, remember how my carry-on had to be checked. When I got to Florida, I was informed that my carry-on had not made it and would not for a several hours. This caused my girlfriend and her family whom I was visiting to have to wait around for several hours. The first relief I had with this terrible experience was the man at baggage claim service who did his best to justify some of the situation. He reimbursed the $30 for checking the missing carry-on and gave me a $10 food voucher to get lunch for the extra hours I was spending at the airport. He told me he deals with the product of terrible service all day and doesn't understand why United doesn't do more to value the customer experience. But he said his input is disregarded whenever he tries to raise the issues he sees everyday that could be easily fixed.

Flying with United airlines and Copa airlines is the worst experience my family and I ever had.

As soon as we arrived to Newark airport we went to the machines to finish out check in and check our luggage. Then we made the line to drop off our luggage we had 6 large pieces of luggage since it was my husband, my self and the ticket we bought for our baby to take the carseat. When they weighed our luggage we had 2 - 50pound pieces, 1 - 37 pound, 1- 42 pound, and 2- 51 pound luggage. The guy who helped us was not friendly at all and indicated us to go back to take the 1 pound that we had over our luggage. After we re packed we went back on line to another rude assistant that passed us. When we waited inside for the flight, I approached the the counter to ask for assistance getting my husband to sit next to my baby and I, they had placed us very far from each other. Same problem rude person said you gotta figure it out inside there's nothing we can do. When we boarded the plane, we realized they had placed my 5 month old baby on a seat separate to mine!

When we went to the airport for baggage claims, Copa Airlines told us that United airlines kept our luggage in Panama and they would take from 24 to 48 hours for us to get our baggage! We came back the next day (keeping us from going to our next destination) for updates and didn't receive anything. Stayed at the airport from 6pm to 1am with no one wanting to help Copa would tell us to come back later and didn't want to help us or give us any updates, they didn't care that I had a 5 month old baby at the airport for hours waiting for any information on our luggage in which we had our baby's clothes, diapers and even medicine. I called United airlines and they said they would arrive at 11pm but of course they didn't. Eventually after talking to everyone in the airport we were able to talk yo someone for them to send the bags to our next destination Loja. They told us we would receive them on Tuesday, we went and they had only sent 2, told us that maybe the next day we'd get the rest. Finally on Wednesday we received the other 2.

Checked in, boarded the plane, sat down, buckled up the whole nine. Aircraft pushed back from the gate at 12:38pm, taxied to get de-iced, because it's winter. After about 20mins and a colourful wash. Yay! I'm on my way- or so I thought. At 1:20pm I saw us heading back to the gate, bare in mind I've now been on this aircraft around 40 mins doing circles on the tarmac, no announcements made. When we finally parked at the gate, the captain came on saying the second engine would not start and they have called for maintenance and we should 'bare with them a minute' I've already bared 50 mins but who's counting. Around 1:50 or so we are told maintenance has arrived and has determined that they are unable to fix the issue and so we will have to disembark. At 2:20pm I got on the phone with United customer service, nice girl, after a 30 minute call she rebooked me on an Air Canada flight for 8:15pm to Houston, bare in mind my final destination is San Antonio. I was told there are no flights to San Antonio that they could get me on, now, I have a graduation at 9am tomorrow, so obviously I need to get there today. Out of frustration I said whatever, book the flight if that's the best you can do and I'll figure out the rest. I did this while in line waiting on the United reps to do rebooking, a line I stood in for over 2hrs. It's finally my turn, instead of being greeted with compassion and understanding, I was greeted with attitude, as if, I wrecked the engine and it was my fault the flight was cancelled or I was late for it. The agent seemed as if we were all bothering her, she wasn't pleasant at all. The only time I saw her smile was at a toddler, at least she likes kids. Though I was already booked on Air Canada, through my own doing, American Airlines had 2 flights out at 6:29pm, I asked if I could get on either flight as they both were going to Dallas then on to San Antonio, her reply was 'we don't have affiliations with American\". She said my only options were to do the whole flight tomorrow or stay over in Houston. I said absolutely not! I told her I'll keep what I have. Now, I'm super happy this engine did not fail while we were in the sky, but, there are ways to make a bad situation better and good customer service would have been one of those ways. No meal vouchers were given, nothing, no compensation in the slightest. In fact, the last apology I heard was from the captain while on the plane. I've been traveling since I was 7 years old, this was my very first time with United and I will never travel with them again! I know stuff happens, aircraft are machines and can have problems but people are not and someone who showed a bit of understanding and care for the passengers would have made all the difference today.

My wife and I are returning from our \u201cDream Vacation\u201d in Bora Bora (BOR); however, getting here and going home have been absolute nightmares. We started our trip on Nov 7th from BWI to SFO. Upon arriving at SFO we decided to upgrade the next (8 hour) leg of the trip to first class, and I can assume that is where the problems began. We arrived in Papeete PPT) without problem, but when we checked in for our flight from PPT to BOR the next morning, one hour before the flight, we are told we do not have tickets. The ticket agent sees that we have confirmed reservations, but says we are not ticketed. She says it appears United Airlines has \u201crefunded\u201d our tickets, and in order to continue on to BOR, we must buy new tickets now and work it out with UA later. With only minutes to spare before they start boarding (10 minutes before departure), we have no option but to purchase new tickets. Mind you this abbreviated version does not include my angry discussion with the Air Tahiti employees, sure they were the ones who had made the mistake, nor my wife\u2019s plea to me to calm down. After arriving in BOR and checking into our resort I got online and sent a message to UA with all of the details I could include in 1,000 characters and pictures of the new ticket receipts, hoping to not only find some resolution, but also ensure we were good to go for our return. Days later my wife received an email confirming receipt of my correspondence, and they would reply in 7 to 14 Days. We attempted to place a wifi-call on 12 November, much to my surprise it went through. For more than two hours I tried to explain the issues to the United Airlines reservation specialist, and eventually supervisor. After the two hours had passed, I was told he could not do anything about the ticketing issues for our trip to BOR, but he assured me we were ticketed and would have no problem for our return flight, and we were emailed a new itinerary with e-ticket numbers. We are leaving BOR today, and decided to leave the comfort of our resort early to avoid a last minute rush if there was a problem with our tickets; we were booked on the last flight out for the night and didn\u2019t have accommodations if we missed it. It came as no surprise this time to me or my wife when we stood a little longer than anyone else at the ticket desk while the agent pounded away at the keyboard, then the familiar question, \u201cmay I see your receipt or itinerary?\u201d Seems the assurance and guarantee of the UA Reservation Supervisor that we would have no problem for our return was worthless, and I am glad we had the foresight to check in for our flight much earlier than necessary. The Chief ticket agent for Air Tahiti in BOR worked for well over an hour to try and find our tickets, with the following conclusions. United did something to take away our tickets and did not give us new ones, and the e-ticket numbers provided to us on our receipt returned \u201cNo information found.\u201d Thus, we were forced once again to purchase tickets we have already once paid for. I asked the agents in BOR if this is a regular occurrence; the Chief agent said \u201cwith United, yes\u201d, and her coworker shook his head in agreement."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "November 2019", "review": "\u2705 Trip Verified |  Orlando to San Jose via Denver.

My partner and I travelled from New Orleans to Houston to LA to Auckland to Brisbane. We booked our flights though Air New Zealand (amazing airline) but unfortunately our flights from New Orleans to Houston and Houston to LA were operated by United. United needs to do much better when dealing with customers who book though another airline but have a connecting flight with United. First of all there was no online check in for our flights. I feel that much of this could have been avoided had we been able to check in online 24 hours before our flight. When we arrived at the airport to check in, the United check in computers wouldn\u2019t recognise our confirmation number, even after a United staff doubled check and entered it herself, the computers said that it was with a different airlines and we would have to check in with them. Somehow the United attendant was able to override it since she could see on her computer that we were booked on the United flight. Then it came to check our bags. On our electronic tickets it says that each person is allowed two bags on each flight. It also has the air New Zealand baggage policy that says 2 bags per person on each flight no matter who the carrier is. My partner and I each had two checked bags. When the United attendant asked how many bags to check, I said two each. She said that since our first flight is operated by United, United baggage rules apply which means we are only allowed one checked bag each and that to check a second bag will be $159USD for each bag. Even though United and Air New Zealand has a partnership agreement that allows us to travel, the United attendant was adamant and blunt saying that the baggage allowance that is on our booking confirmation and tickets does not apply, she wouldn\u2019t even look at the information we had. She made us feel as if we were lying to try to get out of paying baggage fees.

However, these fears were very much put to rest. I paid US$825, all-in including taxes, for a round trip journey of 3 legs in each way. HKG-NRT-IAH-LIM & back (ANA codeshare HKG-NRT). Incredible pricing. Despite the aircraft (B767 & B777) being of some age, the widebodies meant that overhead baggage bins were generally sufficient. The planes were also fitted with  up-to-date IFE (with a huge selection of the latest movies, no lagging or dead screens), and USB & laptop charging ports. The legroom in economy wasn't the best, but manageable. Recline could be better. (I'm 5\"11 or 1.81m and I reckon anyone taller would require their Economy PLUS option), seats were fairly comfortable and I had no problems sleeping 6-7 hours at a go on the 12hr flight and this is in economy. FA service was reasonably hospitable ... but I boarded with low expectations though. Even though we missed our connecting flight due to the flight arriving 3hrs late, the ground staff at Houston  was superb and had no hesitation arranging for us to be on the next flight (with a slight upgrade too), and preparing our confirmation of travel delay for insurance claim purposes. On top of that, he put us up in a decent hotel for the night and provided an $80 meal voucher as well. That turned the initially bad experience into a very decent one. It is also worth noting that the checked baggage arrived with no incident. What was lacking, however was: 1) Barely satisfactory selection of food. Meals were not tasty and very bland. 2) Aisle width was very narrow and the FAs and other passengers kept bumping into me even though I was well within my seat and not spilling out.

We staff told us that the flight had been delayed and that there had been a change of aircraft but the flight was now in the air, somewhere. We asked why the repeated and long delay? It was because of the weather they said. This was the first I heard about a \"weather problem\" and only just before they had said that there had been a change of airplane? We asked if there was something they could do. It was four and a half hours until our flight would leave, maybe, and we wanted to know if there was any other option. Any other airline or route? The answer was that they checked just before and all other routes and airlines were full. We asked if they could get us into the lounge since it would be a little more comfortable for such a long wait. The answer was \"Sure, for 59 dollars I can\". Then we asked if there was anything at all UA could do to help us and alleviate the long wait? The answer was that because it was a weather problem it was out of the hands of UA so you will just have to wait. I asked what kind of weather. The lady in front of me said they didn't know and the lady next to her said \"It was a snow storm\". She said that with a smirk. (Today is Sep 15.) Now I was a little bit upset and I asked if they really wanted me to believe that weather was the cause of this delay. The answer was \"Are you calling me a liar?\". A bit of an escalation, quite unnecessary I thought. I said \"No, but you're telling me it is a weather issue but you don't know what it is?\". \"Well we just don't know. It's just the air traffic control, they don't tell us anything\". At this point I asked if she could just get us a pass to the lounge for $59 each. The answer was \"You have to the lounge to get that\". Then we went to the lounge, only to be met with a sign that said they were full and couldn't accept any more open passes. Having a background in Customer Service, I find that UA today neatly ticked every missed opportunity and made every error in the book."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "September 2019", "review": "\u2705 Trip Verified |  Oklahoma City to Denver.

As a mother, I am very appreciative of United's policy on being family friendly, however, not at the expense of other paying customers. Part of the problem I encountered on this flight maybe could have been avoided. A very adorable toddler sat directly behind me and was not a happy camper, and expressed it for the whole duration of the flight. Although, this was highly stressful for all parties involved, sometimes this can happen. However, this was excessive. In my opinion the mother was ill prepared to distract, entertain, or comfort her toddler. In this case she could have done a much better job, but sometimes children are inconsolable no matter what parents do. Given that there is such tight seating, the little guy literally kicked the back of my seat the whole 4 hour flight. It was very stressful. Having former back surgery this was very uncomfortable. I leaned forward in my seat for the majority of the flight putting strain on my back as well. I could not sit comfortably in my seat at all. In addition, I tried listening to a movie through earbuds, but having to press the earbuds into my ears just to hear. Even then, it didn't drown out the screaming. Being very tolerant and sympathetic to the little guy, I endured because it isn't his fault. I think we adults can do a better job in regards making children more comfortable during flight. I think that policy can change to help all parties involved. If United is truly family friendly and they care about their other paying customers, they can make the premier seating available to families first at no extra charge. The little ones would have more room to move around, and parents have more room to handle a wiggling uncomfortable toddler. Another option could be, for children under two years of age, the child gets a seat at no extra cost. Both of those options would truly be more friendly to all customers, but it would cut into profits. This is a real problem especially when it goes beyond a little fussiness which everyone expects.

Did you want your flight to dependably arrive on time? Too bad you can't pay extra for that. Unless the stars align, you're SOL if you're flying United.

This is the worst experience I have had with an airline. Too begin with, Newark airport is the worst airport in America. After arriving 2 hours early for my flight I only just made my flight, there was only ONE single united employee behind the desk, it took me an hour to check in my bags. Then there is the fact that it took another hour to wait in line just to get through customs because of the horrendous system at Newark international. But this is not even my main complaint, once on the plane we waited a total of 5 hours on the tarmac before the plane took off to LA. I have never in my life heard of people waiting this long to take off. Even when we pulled back into the gate after 3 hours stuck on the plane, we were told not to leave because if we did and the plane was ready to go, they would leave without us. This experience only gets worse. Because we were not taking off the flight attendants refused to serve any food meals. Because I had planned to buy food before my flight and couldn\u2019t because the of the agonising wait time at the airport, I had not eaten a proper meal in 12 hours. I was forced to remain in basically inhumane conditions unable to eat, starving for the longest time in my life. Once the plane finally left the airport, it was inevitable that the only hot meal they had available was a hotdog and due to the terrible service, they ran out of them very quickly (most people didn\u2019t get a meal). Once I finally arrived in Los Angeles, United supplied those that missed their connecting flights new tickets. My new flight is now 18 hours from the time I arrived in LA. I have never waited this long for a new flight in my life. I have travelled South America and even in impoverished countries with low budget flights, I was NEVER EVER forced to wait so long for another flight. On top of this, we were given only $30 dollars for meal vouchers. That equates to 1 meal and a snack in Los Angeles, so how does united expect you to survive a full day on only 1 meal? The truth is that they don\u2019t! They expect you to pay for your own food and drinks while you wait for a flight that they messed up. When I asked for at least more food vouchers I was told that it was \u201cagainst policy\u201d to give more and the lead manager apologised for the \u201cembarrassing \u201d customer service from United. Even your own employees understand how embarrassing this excuse for an airline is. To compensate me for the fact I am now missing a family event, they offered a measly 100-dollar voucher on the next flight I decide to take with the company. The further problem with this pathetic severance for this awful experience is that it expires within a year! So you have a deadline to fly again with this tragic airline. I\u2019m writing all this because you should know that I will not be accepting the horrible service and \u201capology\u201d I have received.

The first and second legs of our flights were with Austrian Airlines (OS 0082 and OS 0721) on July 11 and 15 which went through without a hitch and in most courteous and professional manner by Austrian. The third leg was with Czech Airlines (OK 079) on July 19 which again was also completed without a hitch. However, the fourth and fifth leg of the flight (UA 0187 and UA 2394) on July 23 were total disasters. In Prague airport, we were told that due to weather conditions the flight would be delayed approx 7 hours. Having given no other options for other United flights or otherwise, we had to wait out the delay and board the plane about 7 hours later. In New Jersey, having missed our connecting flight to LAX, again without any other options given by United, we had to stay overnight in Ramada Plaza Hotel (a virtual dump of a Hotel) for about 4 hours before returning to the airport for a 6am standby! Although vouchers were issued for the hotel (United's choice) and some food, we had to take a cab at our expense to the hotel, as no vouchers were provided, and it was very late at night. During all the interactions with United employees, customer service, supervisors, and hotel crew we were treated unprofessionally, rudely, nonchalantly, carelessly, and aggressively. At all times, the attitude of the United employees was insulting and such that they couldn't care less about our dilemma, and that they had heard these sort of complaints a million times before, that it is what it is, and basically take it or leave it. Beside suffering the aggravation and stress, the above delays, totaling a whole day, caused tremendous backlash for my wife and I, as we are both professionals with appointments and commitments to meet (which we missed), having counted on the on-time arrival in LAX. We could not even spend our food vouchers due to lack of time, and United flight crew denying our vouchers for food on the plane (EWR to LAX), and the Mexican Grill denial of vouchers in the food court of LAX arrivals. The way we see it, United has received its full payment for the tickets, but we have not received the full service promised nor have been compensated for our losses suffered. To say the least, improper actions or non-actions of United have bitterly ended a much-anticipated joyful vacation. If you have a choice, avoid United, and spare yourself lots of heartache."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "August 2019", "review": "Cincinnati to Washington. The flight itself was fine, the pilot did a good job, the other passengers around me were great, and one of the two flight attendants (female) was very kind. My issues with this flight, which caused me great distress, stem from one flight attendant (male) who publicly humiliated me. I was traveling alone with my 16-month-old son from Cincinnati to DC \u2013 the second flight he\u2019d ever taken in his life. He\u2019d done pretty well on our outbound flight a few days prior (his first-ever flight); - I scheduled it around his naptime so he slept the whole time. This flight I\u2019d scheduled around his bedtime, hoping for the same thing (that he\u2019d sleep). In the hours before the flight while in the airport, I did everything I could to get him tired \u2013 let him run around the airport (CVG has an amazing children\u2019s room!); gave him dinner, a snack, and a bottle; gave him Motrin in case his ears would bother him on the plane; changed him into pajamas. As soon as we got on the plane, I got him comfortable and read him a few books, which is the normal bedtime routine. It was clear after a few minutes that he had no interest in sleeping, and was very interested about what was happening outside the window and around him in the cabin, so I accepted he\u2019d be awake for the duration of the 90-minute flight. There was an empty seat next to us, so I put his bag there so that I could easily access his books and toys to keep him occupied \u2013 which worked for the majority of the flight. The issues began when we started our descent into IAD. The fasten seat belt sign turned on, so I began gathering up my son\u2019s toys and books into the bag to put the bag under the seat in front of us. The male flight attendant began impatiently and aggressively moving my bag under the seat before it was even zipped up. I had a ton of items in there \u2013 toys, bottles, my purse, an iPad \u2013 and I had to ask him to stop so that I could actually zip my bag so that everything didn\u2019t fall out and potentially roll down the aisle of the plane. Then, now that the seat next to me was empty, my son was very interested in trying to get into that seat (this entire time he\u2019d been sitting on my lap). I knew that if I continued to hold him on my lap that he would start to fuss, so I put him in the seat next to me, while holding on to him the entire time (he was never once out of my grip). The male flight attendant returned and told me it was unsafe for him to be in that seat and I would have to put him on my lap. My son was trying to stand in the seat and face the passengers behind us \u2013 granted he\u2019s only about 30 inches tall \u2013 but the flight attendant said that if we had turbulence that he\u2019d hit his head. I told him that I understood, but was trying to explain that he was fussing sitting in my lap, that I was trying to not disturb the other passengers, and that I had a solid grip on him. The flight attendant responded with \u201cno, I do not think you understand\u201d and continued to berate me for having my son in unsafe conditions. So, I put my son in my lap, and brought back out all the books I had packed away in my bag, in addition to the iPad and my iPhone, to see if he\u2019d remain calm in my lap. No dice. My son began to cry and scream and try to wiggle out of my grasp, because he wanted to sit in the seat next to me. The flight attendant returned, saying that I needed to \u201cget control of my child.\u201d I explained to him all the things I was doing, and asked him what else he wanted me to do. He did not respond to my question, walked off, and that was the last time I saw him on the flight. My son continued to be unhappy and cry (and in my opinion, be more unsafe, because I was constantly having to adjust my grip on him to keep him in my lap) for the remainder of the flight. I\u2019m the daughter and granddaughter of pilots. I\u2019ve been in planes all my life. I understand plane safety more than the average person, and would never allow myself or my child to be in an unsafe position on a plane. I also greatly care about the comfort of others around me (I even brought extra earplugs with me and offered them to the people sitting around me), and was very upset that my son caused their flight experience to be subpar because he was so noisy. However, I am most upset by the blatant shaming of this flight attendant, who came to me on three separate occasions to berate me, the way I was managing my child, and how I was affecting other passengers. His words and actions brought me to tears in public, and I cannot believe that someone who is employed to attend to passengers on a flight would have so little compassion for a mother flying solo with her young child, who was clearly trying to follow the rules, and clearly struggling.

Yesterday, we were delayed boarding the plane, then had to get off and wait 2 hours to board back on. Then, we sat on the plane for about 30 min after they said we were going to begin moving onto the runway. We then moved onto the runway and then had to wait for something else the crew had to check, which about 15 more minutes. My TV in front of me also was inoperable, so my friend and I used their TV. Well, we tried, but the aux for the headphones was not working properly and we could not use the TV. Then once we got off the plane, apparently when we so happened to book our hotel in Houston from L.A., it never actually got booked. So we had to book it at Houston. Then we got two free meal vouchers. Which, I thank you for that, but, it was late at night and I didn't know that all of the restaurants closed at 10pm, so once I was ready, I went up to order and they were closed. Even the self serve and self pay stand was closed!  Then we went to pick up our bags at the baggage claim. We were not told which carousel to go to, so we were just wandering around the building looking for our bags, until someone finally brought them over from outside the building. Absolutely no communication with associates or to passengers. We also had to stay the night in Houston. Thankfully they gave us a free night at a hotel. We then went out to wait for the shuttle to go to the hotel, and we sat there for a good 20 minutes or so until we decided to take an Uber because they were taking way too long. In the morning, while going through security, I had already stepped through the scanner and had gotten my items that were in the tray and was just waiting for my bookbag. It was still in the scanner and then got pulled off to the side and it just sat there for a good 15 minutes when someone finally brought it over just to look through it and give it back. I had no trouble going through security with the same airline, the flight before this with the exact same objects that were in the bag. And check-out from the hotel was at 12pm and our flight wasn't until 6:30pm, so we had to wait in the airport all day when we could have stayed at the hotel for a few more hours and relaxed. Later, it was almost time to start boarding, and we are told there is a 2 hour delay because the crew/captain was not there yet. Thankfully it got moved up to 6:50 and we finally left around 7pm and arrived in Dayton around 9:30pm with no trouble. Everyone was nice, just, no one knows what they are doing and do not have any communication. Which is most likely why there are so many problems, not just with this flight but with many others.

They then promised to have it delivered within 24 hours, and once again, that was incorrect. 36 hours later, I received a soaking wet suitcase and no apology. It has been almost 2 months since the incident and we are still waiting for someone to reimburse us for the flight as well as the items that we had to buy to manage 36 hours without our stuff.

I have flown back and forth to Asia many times on other Asian carriers, 4 times in the last year. Check-in in San Francisco was quick and efficient. I was given a priority pass for the security line which helped bypass the long lines. The Polaris business class lounge at SFO is one of the best in the world. Boarding the flight was on time with a separate line for business class. The flight attendants were very welcoming and professional. The business class seating on the Dreamliner was 2x2x2, all with double pods. There is some degree of separation. The seats were comfortable, but in the fully flat bed configuration, my feet were touching against the end of the pod in a small opening which cramped my feet together and I am 5'10\" tall. A taller person would find this very uncomfortable. I was sitting in 3B and I am a million miler flown on United. However, my first choice meal selection was not available as they had run out? The IFE selection is excellent, one of the best in the industry, but the television screen is fixed to the seat in front of you and cannot be tilted or moved. If you recline your seat and are looking at the screen at an angle, the quality of the screen diminishes and looses color and contrast. The overall trip was comfortable and ontime. I would have to say the flight was good, but not great. The Asian carriers flying the same route offer a much higher level of privacy with individual pods and larger beds and the quality and selection of food and service is outstanding."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "July 2019", "review": "Not Verified |  Houston to Norfolk.

She asked everybody to go to the front office and rebook another flight. I immediately headed to the front desk and tried to find an alternative. I was told by United airlines staff that there was no flight until the next day and that would take me to New York late afternoon. That was not good enough for me as I had a 18:00 job interview on June 19th and a meeting early morning June 20th. So, I asked for alternatives. The person at the front desk said there was no other alternative and suggested to refund the cost of the ticket. My checking with American and Delta confirmed the same. She immediately put the refund request in United\u2019s system. I was very disappointed and immediately started calling all the necessary people and try and re-schedule the job interviews.When I arrived back home I called the hotel I had booked and asked for possible cancellation of my booking. The hotel immediately denied refund as it was last minute but finally asked for a letter of flight cancellation from United so that they can possibly consider. I called United customer service and after half an hour of waiting, they directed me to a webpage where I could ask for a full refund of the hotel cost as well aside from the flight cost. I stayed on the phone to do exactly what they directed me to do and attached the hotel bill on that form. As soon as I finished the call my wife called me (I had notified her earlier) and she told me that the flight was en route to Newark. She asked me to check the google flight status. I did and I saw that the flight was reported en-route to Newark. I tried to call the airport but to no avail. I decided to go back and find out what happened. At the airport I asked the employee who told me that the flight was cancelled and suggested the refund but she avoided me saying she never suggested a refund to me or said that the flight was cancelled. Then I asked for the supervisor, who aggressively tried to lead me to the side of the office and avoided offering any explanation He aggressively asked me to wait in an office with a young employee who knew nothing and just waited there for 10 mins without anything happening. I asked for the name of the person who refunded my ticket and the name of the supervisor but she denied offering them and called security. Needless to say I was extremely polite and respectful to all. I told her that it was not necessary as I only wanted to file a complaint with United (as I saw there was no way for me to fly and would like to have the names of the employees involved.) Security came and offered the name of the supervisor but not the name of the employee who cancelled my ticket. I left the office disenchanted.

On a recent United flight (UA 138) that I had booked in February 2019 for a Flight on 24. June 2019, the following happened to me and other passengers, please note that several other groups of passengers experienced the same thing on this flight and have reported to have seen the same practice on other flights as well. I was traveling with my two underage children ages 13 and 15. I was placed in Row 12E while my children were both placed in Row 20, which is an Exit row. Note that my 15 year old is old enough to sit in this row and assist other passengers in an emergency but my 13 year old is most certainly not and cannot sit there per FAA regulations. When I stated that we need to moved elsewhere the flight employees told me to just switch seats with the 13 year old. Subsequently I protested and informed the flight employees that none of us want to sit in an Exit row, even though I am old enough, I do not want to sit in an Exit neither. My 13 year was subsequently moved to row 12E and I was left without a seat. Finally I was told to move to the back of the airplane Row 34 \u2018somewhere\u02bc (no specific seat was given to me) and my 15 year old was left in the Exit row on his own. At this point I switched with another passenger at the front row 7 which was closer to my children than Row 34. The Stewardess on this Flight then informed me this is also an Exit row. (She later remarked that since I called her a \u2018Stewardess\u2019 I do not fly very often. Despite the fact I\u2019m in the air every month. She really went out of her way to be insulting.) I repeated the fact that I don\u02bct want to sit in any exit rows and I want my second child also moved away from the Exit row. I repeated that I believed that it\u02bcs FAA regulations that we must agree to sit there and agree to assist or be moved and would they please move us. At this point the Stewardess started to get very aggravated and said \u2018we offered you a seat in the back\u2018 and you didn\u02bct take it and subsequently switched me again from Row 7C to 8C. She rolled her eyes an also stated that \u2018here we go again, acting demeaning and rude. I didn\u02bct \u2018buy\u02bc a seat that means they can put me wherever, even in an exit row- apparently even without my consent. I would like to add here that I very much liked to have bought assigned seats; however the first opportunity I got in the entire purchase / check-in process was two hours before boarding when all the seats for sitting together already were taken. In summary my 13 year old was placed into Row 12E and my 15 year old was in an exit Row 20 the entire flight although he was a minor and I did not agree for him to sit there. Finally in the last 30 minutes I approached the staff again to re-seat us. Furthermore security measures ask for parents to assist children during a flight with oxygen masks as well as ensure that seatbelts are worn between and after bathroom breaks. How can a parent assure that this happens properly when the parent is placed on the opposite side of the airplane with isles blocked by carts and other people? In my case this was not as big of a deal as my children are teenagers but there was another group of passengers where the parent was split from a 6 year old child and the child was expected to basically fly on their own?

The inflight service is OK with a rather friendly flight attendant. I'd suggest that if check-in can be made out of the airport why doesn\u2019t baggage tag print can be done at the same time at home and we just tap the QR code at the check-in to get tags? This would allow more time for customers to be less clumsy and less time consuming. To me, some of the UA staff should learn more manners. We pay for their service and salaries and we are not paying to do self-service with rude manners.

Over the years I have been increasingly dissatisfied with the customer service of United Airlines employees. So far I haven't really had an issue with flight attendants but the counter staff seem to be getting worse with every trip I take. This trip I was actually on an American Airlines flight that was cancelled and was rebooked on a United Airlines flight by AA. My original flight was to be at 7:00 am. I was rebooked on a 10:20 am flight on UA. I went directly to UA customer service once AA had given me the informatiom via text and email. The UA staff have me what looked like a boarding pass but told me that I had to go to the gate counter to get a seat assignment before I could board. I did and proceeded to sit and wait for at least an hour after that. I boarded with the appropriate boarding group and proceeded to my seat to buckle up. Just before the doors were closed, I was called to the front and told to bring my carry ons. They proceeded to tell me I couldn't fly because they hadn't gotten the confirmation from AA. They brought my suitcase up, stood it on the floor, shoved it to roll over to me and said come on, we have to close the door. I realize a mistake had been made by AA, but I felt that if there was a problem with my reservation, there was plenty of time to realize this in the over 2-1/12 hours from when the reservation had been made to when I was kicked off the plane. If the customer service agent had indicated any problem I would have had time to resolve it. If the gate agent has mentioned it when he assigned me a seat - both instances would have allowed me to correct the situation. I can't describe it, but after the stress of the morning, and the attitude of the gate attendant that took me off the plane I was left in tears standing outside the door. She just moved past me after locking the door and never looked back or offered any guidance on what to do. I was humiliated and stranded the second time that day.

We were unable to reach any baggage rep, the phone would ring and never was picked up. We tried to call the airport directly and never made it to a live rep for assistance. We called United because it was the airline we booked our reservation through. The rep kept telling us that the baggage loss was due to Lufthansa, Star Alliance Partner, so we would have to call that airline for assistance. Frustrating, but we followed the information given to us by the United rep and attempted to call Lufthansa. Lufthansa would not ever pick up the phone. 48 hours of trying to call Lufthansa, still the phone was never answered. Again, we called United for assistance with Lufthansa and the rep was unable to get the airline to answer. The United rep told us he would call us back in 1 hour with an update on our luggage. We of course waited and the call back never came. On the 72hr of still not having luggage and not a single update from either airline or the claim center, we called United once again. This time the rep was able to tell us that our bags never made it on our connecting flight from Newark to Munich and our bags where still in the United States and we scheduled on a flight to Germany and would make it to Naples Italy at 10:30 that night. The next morning we called United to make sure our luggage did make it to Italy and the rep told us we had no baggage claim submitted and we needed to file one at the airport in Italy and again we needed to call Lufthansa. After 4 days with no luggage, half of our trip, we called our chauffeur that picked us up in Italy to drive us to our villa. We asked if he had any idea how we could get in contact with anyone at the Naples airport to find out if our bags made it or were even in route. He had a driver that was picking up at the airport go to the claim and ask about our missing luggage. He was able to verify that our bags did finally arrive at the airport and a rep would be bringing them to our villa that day. At the end of day 4, we finally received our missing luggage. We understand flights get delayed and bags get lost. All we wanted was answers from United and they were unable to provide that, blaming other airlines, and providing terrible customer service.

The lineup at the customer service centre was awful having to wait over one hour just to plan our next flight. We were travelling with some friends that we were supposed to be on the same flight of our final leg to Honolulu which caused some issues with our itinerary as we were unable to land together. On our way home, our flight from San Fran to Chicago was delayed by 1.5 hrs due to the weather which made us miss our connecting flight once again in Chicago. Our next flight was not scheduled for another 4hrs that morning. We understand that weather causes delays but to have our next leg be delayed by an extra 4 hours after already having travelled for almost 24 hrs seems to be excessive.There was also an earlier flight we could have been placed on, however the customer service representative did nothing to try and see if there was any way we could make that flight.

United didn't have a flight that worked and so I flew back on a different airline. It didn't occur to me that United wouldn't just send my bag back to my originating airport. Instead they want to charge me to have my bag FedExed to me - a very hostile staff in their baggage department clearly needs a vacation and a reminder that she works in a free country. I have tried to explain my circumstances as being unusual but apparently people book flights now and get off after only one leg because it is cheaper. I'm not sure if I understand this particular phenomenon, but I do understand when a company has blown past their sell-by date and needs to be cut down to size. If customers are using their system in a way that they don't care for - fix your pricing. It is unacceptable to take someone's bag, tell them that you aren't holding it hostage when you are doing exactly that. The airline has no right to insist that I prove anything nor does the airline have any right to penalize customers for not completing their itinerary.

I opted for the cheapest option for my flight - basic economy, which was a huge mistake. They did not authorize changes, cancellations, or adjustments at any time immediately after purchase. After waiting on the phone for 20 minutes, I was greeted by a customer service representative who basically just told me there\u2019s nothing they could do and maybe try contacting my ticket issuer, Capitol One. I had applied some reward points to deduct about $93 from my over $400 round trip ticket from Killeen TX to El Paso TX. I contacted them only to be told that United is the only company authorized to make changes to my flight itinerary, which I can only imagine the original United rep has already known (or should have at least). Essentially she had just pointed fingers elsewhere to avoid problem solving. We are also not even allowed a carry on item at this rate, which seems completely unreasonable. The price of their economy tickets are not comparable to other airlines such as Frontier or Southwest, which makes it more confusing as to why they are so strict (the fact that I regularly use cheap airlines should indicate that my standards are not high to begin with, I just like affordable travel). On the same token, even if I had paid a higher fare to be able to carry on items and adjust my flight, I still would be sitting in the same dingy aircraft crammed next to the person in the seat next to me. I would almost be insulted that I bothered to pay the $50-100 more for the same poorly maintained vehicle.

The seat did not recline either, so I sat there, sitting up at 90 degrees, being bumped for an hour from both sides. Furthermore, their WiFi is both overpriced and limiting.

United Airlines are the ones that changed our flight schedules, as we were not asked nor did we volunteer.

Apparently United Airlines does not realize there are reasons as to why people choose the flight schedules they want, or for that matter as to what Airline to use - maybe United does not appreciate our business. When we booked our vacation at the beginning of January we could of used other Airlines, and maybe should have.

The luggage line after 2 hours hadn\u2019t moved hardly any people. Three reps from United had absolutely no clue what to do. People who had to stay overnight and needed to retrieve their luggage were sent on a wild goose chase all over the airport. Three hours after the flight was supposed to have left, the agents at the check in gates, overwhelmed and utterly confused, finally started, with three baggage claim checks at a time, disappeared for 15-30 minutes at a time to retrieve 3 bags.

One said too much rain for 1.5 hours of the delay and the other said too much wind for the other 1.5 hour delay. Landed in San Francisco the ground was barely wet and there was no wind at all.

There is a lot of stress involved with this quarterly trip and I will not go into that. In any event, I was in my Uber on my way back from MD Anderson to the airport and I had to call United because I was having an error checking in online. I actually was taking the trip to NYC instead of Rochester because the flights were to high and because of my medical situation, I am limited financially and need to be very frugal about my trips for my treatments. So I decided it would be cheaper to fly into NYC, vist the night with a friend and take the train the next day! In my call to United from my Uber, we realized that I had booked the trip back home on March 13th instead of Feb 13th. I had never noticed the error. The United employee on the phone said she could book me for a later flight that day but it would be $700 additional dollars on top of my flight. (I purchased the flight insurance because of fear of problems but since the error was on my end, I'm sure I wouldn't have been helped by the insurance.) In any event, I told her I would just talk to someone when I got the airport but she did say they wouldn't do any better!. I was beyond stressed as with the whole medical situation and having to travel alone and the cost the quarterly trips take with hotels and travel etc. I went to talk to the United employee who was at the Airport and when I started to explain what happened, I just lost it. I went to pieces. And I am the type of person who never cries in front of anyone, let alone in a public place.I couldn't even explain what happened I was too upset.

Both made it clear that if the bike bag fell within weight and dimensional limits it would be charged simply as a second item of checked baggage i.e. $50. When I checked in at the airport, the United agent insisted that I owed an extra $200 (!) for the bike even though it came in under 50 lb limit and was the standard dimensions set out in the Airline's limits. No amount of back and forth would bring them round to honour the original terms. And curiously my two companions who had checked in a little earlier for the same flights also with bikes were charged much less - one paid $25 as it was his first and only item of checked luggage and the other was charged nothing for his bike as second item (his was in an identical Evoc bike bag and weighed just a little more than mine).

This was my first time flying a United long haul international route. I made sure I included long haul since you can fly a 90 minute international flight from Chicago to Toronto which is no different from their domestic service. I flew in their soft-release of Premium Economy on my way to Hong Kong, and regular economy in my return flight. I say soft-release since in reality you only get the new seats, and not the full service which goes live down the road - the new seats are great! I got into these seats due to the new 777-200 configuration on my trip to Hong Kong which is a 3-4-3 setup in economy, and 2-3-2 in Premium Economy. I had a front row seat which means the tray and TV comes out from underneath the seat, and both worked really well. The seat itself is wider than regular economy by a couple of inches, and you can feel it. It also reclines by an inch more which didn't make much of a difference to me since I need a full bed to sleep well, but it was nice to lay back a little more with the foot rest they provide. You have a nice little storage container on the side of the seat which is perfect for tablets and smart phones, and the chargers worked great. It charged my phone up quickly, and it was easy to open and pull out my tablet when I watched some shows. The screen these new seats have is notably wider, and had a very responsive touch screen that worked well, and the quality was in HD. I watched the latest Mission Impossible, and the screen felt like a nice tablet now. On top of that, the entertainment selections were great. They had a lot of new movies, classics, and international choices. Overall if the Premium Economy is only a 25-33% upgrade cost, then get it for the seat alone. That said, I had the old 777-200 configuration on the return flight, and there is no Premium Economy seats yet. The biggest disappointment in the old configuration is no chargers, or they don't work. I know the old configuration is on it's way out, thank god, but they haven't been touched much since the 90s. United loses a point for not at least adding some proper chargers by 2010. Otherwise, it's a typical economy seat. Not bad, but nothing notable. Finally, the service itself overall was good. Obviously your crew will vary, but it seems like the international crew to and from Hong Kong was friendly and top notch. They had all announcements in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin which is great for the Chinese travelers on board. To me it says a lot how they accommodate foreign travelers to where you're heading. As I said earlier, the service was very friendly and active. Meanwhile the food isn't bad. The breakfast on United is quite good since I had the omelet on the way over, and the quiche on the way back. The dinner was okay, but overall it's 4/5 for the food. Overall United gets a solid review from me. I think they are treated a little unfair at times. Are they ANA? Of course not, but they aren't a 2-3 out of 10. To me a 2 signals they are god awful, and that isn't the case. The only true negative is the Wi-Fi, and it isn't worth the price. As long as the flight is smooth, comfortable, and the staff is friendly, then they do a solid job.

No instruction was given to connecting flight passengers as to how we should proceed. Alongside several customers on the flight, we had under an hour to clear border control check, hand luggage check and get to the gate (this was at least a 10 minute walk away from the baggage check). At Border control, staff were very rude at a clearly stressful point. When told about my situation, they just told me to join the back of the queue. I was told to speak with a United Airline representative, but no employees were working at the time. Three different individuals I had asked throughout this entire process gave no care. I even tried to join my friend at the back of the other queue and was told to go back. He managed to get on the flight. At baggage check, the queue moved at a steady pace but once my bag was on the machine, there seemed no urgency with getting checks through the machine. Machine stood at a standstill for about 10 minutes. When one of the employees was asked by a couple next to me about the hold up, they laughed and just said they were waiting for another person to monitor the scanning. After my friend had informed the check in desk of my situation, I arrived at the gate 1 minute (8:16) after the flight departure time. I was told by United airline staff to join a long queue of people waiting to speak to customer service. The customer service desk was next to my flight gate at E2. This was an even greater example of the poor customer service on display as I began queuing at 8:18pm and was not served by a customer service employee for the airline until 9:10pm. Up until 9:00pm They had one employee serving all economy travellers and one other serving premium. There was no employee around to even speak with customers waiting in the queue. At roughly 9pm they finally brought out 4 more employees. After eventually being served, the staff was very helpful in clearly a stressful situation. Rather concerning was the fact her colleagues seemed to be more interested in talking about their diets and whether they could have some of the chocolates out on the desk than serving the long queue of dismayed customers in front of them. After receiving my hotel and food vouchers at 9:29pm, I decided to grab some food and go across to the Marriott Hotel. After thinking this experience could not get any worse with this airline, I was informed that the credit given for this hotel did not even cover half the room rate. I was given a voucher for $57.33 and the total room amount came to $139.23 ($81.90 deficit). As an airline that is meant to uphold strong customer service qualities (this I read in my magazine on the returning flight to Houston from Guatemala - they even had a page devoted to it in the magazine), I can safely say in the last 18 years of flying all over the world that this was by far the worst experience of customer service I have ever seen.

Booking through United Airlines was the worse mistake I\u2019ve ever made. Once we left SJD airport (Cabo) at 12:05 pm everything seemed normal until we got closer to (IAH) Houston we were suppose to arrive there at 4:30 pm to make it to our connecting flight at 7:45pm and we were supposed to reach our destination at 11:38 but the pilot said we had to go to San Antonio for a little bit until the storm cleared up when we landed in San Antonio to get more fuel he then told us that since he exceeded the maximum number of hours to fly for the day which was 12 hours that we had to wait for the new crew to board which will take about 45 minutes. So went through customs as instructed and got some food because they told us that we won\u2019t be able to leave until 8:15 pm. While waiting the airline staff told us that they will have to reschedule our flight but they will put us in a hotel room once we reach Houston, TX.Then we start waited and they they boarded us on the plane around 10 pm to wait some more. Finally we take off around 10:30 pm and reach Houston around 11:30 and we spoke with a customer service representative and she said they will not give us a room because it was weather related but the pilot told us he ran out of hours to fly for the day. So then we got stuck staying in the Houston airport overnight waiting for our flight at 12:00pm. Then around 10:00 am I received notification that our plane wasn\u2019t going to arrive until 2:06 since they had to find a plane for us. So then I spoke with another rep and she said they weren\u2019t going to do anything for the inconvenience or even offer a food voucher. And we were stuck at the airport with nothing since our bags already made it to Baltimore. The thing that makes me even more disgusted is the fact that my cousin that flew through Southwest leaving a few minutes after us was able to get from Cabo to Houston without any delays and she made it back to BWI by 11:45 pm on 10/31 while me and my other 3 cousins made it to BWI at 5:30 pm on 11/1.

I was pleasantly surprised by how normal or pleasant it was. For one thing, my flights either arrived on time or early! For the international leg (i.e. HKG-ORD and subsequently ORD-HKG), service was quite good. While the 777s they operated both seemed a bit old, but the cabin was in good repair. My HKG-ORD flights were on 777s with the 3x3x3 seating configuration- an increasingly rare sight, though really, there's not that much of a difference compared to 3x4x3. I think their food is pretty decent. I normally fly Cathay and I liked the food on United better - I especially appreciate that the snack was a sandwich, not a pot of instant noodles. Cabin crew were quite friendly and periodically walked the aisle with water. I also appreciate their provision of Illy's coffee. While it is by no means the best coffee in the world, it's a high quality brand nonetheless. My flight managed to arrive in Chicago roughly 2 hours ahead of schedule, which was great because the member of staff that rechecked my bag to my connecting flight was kind enough to help me get booked on to the earlier flight- she didn't seem particularly enthused, but I suppose that's understandable when it takes about 10 minutes to actually put everything together, so I appreciate her effort either way. Now to talk about their domestic product- My flight to Minneapolis St. Paul was onboard one of their mainline flights, which operated on an A319. The interior and the seats seemed quite new, and the leather seats that they had were actually quite comfy. There is no seatback TV (which I'm used to for these short hop flights), but they do have onboard WiFi like they do on the international flights that allow you to view movies on your device for free- that makes up for it. The cabin crew for the flight seemed somewhat less hospitable onboard, and for the hour and a half flight- the a bag of pretzels and water was provided- there wasn't a proper beverage service. On my way back, I had a very pleasant encounter with the check in staff at MSP, where they answered some technical questions (mainly regarding whether I had to reclaim my bag at ORD like I did on the way in) as I checked my bag and were kind enough to carry my bag onto the conveyor belt. As I was flying on a United Express Flight that operated an Embraer E-175, boarding was fast since it is a very small plane. For this particular flight, I had very friendly cabin crew and full beverage service (including hot coffee). I also got a very nice bag of cookies. This flight also went without a hitch. I would remark however, that seeing as all United Express flights are docked at Terminal 2 in Chicago while mainline United flights are docked in Terminal 1, it is quite a long walk between the terminals- then again they did give me a 3 hour layover, so I probably needed that and more. Based on this experience, I'd definitely give United another go. They really aren't that bad.

I paid an extra $130 to fly into a closer airport for convenience, but our flight was directed about an hour and a half away (via driving). The pilot said a plane had broken down on the runway so we'd have to taxi around until it was cleared. Well about 30-40 minutes later he announced that we were running out of fuel and needed to re-fuel at the airport 1.5 hrs away. After deboarding and waiting at the gate to refuel for another 2 hrs we were told if we didn't take off within 20 minutes that the crew would surpass legal work hours and our flight back to the original airport would be cancelled. Of course we couldn't have boarded and taken off in that time, so we were all left stranded nearly 2 hrs from where we needed to be. Since we'd been in limbo not knowing if our flight was delayed or cancelled, we couldn't make proper arrangements for getting home in the 3 hrs we sat there. They told us to speak to customer service (which was another hour wait) just so we could be told that all shuttles were booked, there were no flights with the next 12 hrs, and that the cancellation was \"weather related\" so they wouldn't reimburse us for travel expenses. (We descended to land and there definitely were NO weather/fog issues...) Basically our only options were to pay another $200 to rent a car or Uber home, or to be stuck at a hotel for a few hours until the next available flight. I had already paid an extra $130 for convenience and that was ruined by waiting an extra 3+ hours in an airport and dealing with snotty customer service people; I wasn't about to pay another $200 to get home! I could've lived with taking an Uber or driving myself home if United would've reimbursed us, but they refused... so instead I had to stay at the hotel and wait for another flight the next day.

We wanted to try to get an earlier flight so I started to approach the \u201cadditional services\u201d counter. However, the attendants started yelling that the counter was only for missed flights. The whole time we were there, the people at the counter were yelling at everyone to use the kiosk. There was no-one there welcoming us and answering questions, they assumed that we should know their process and yelled when we didn\u2019t.

Our flight was a total of 10 hours and 10 hours and 20 minutes long. Departing time was 5:15pm - 12:35pm. The flight price was $1,394. I gave it a average of 7 stars, based on the overall stars of 21. I feel the value for money was not where you want it to be. The flight was bearable, but not extremely comforting, there were times where I had to really get creative in the position of my body to get at least 20 minutes of sleep. Leg room was mediocre at best. A passenger sitting next to me who was a little over six foot had 0 space between his knees and the seat in front, he sometimes had to press his foot against the seat in front. Seat Comfort = 2/5 - Value For Money = 2/5 In terms of the cabin crew, they were not nice, but they were not rude either. You could tell some flight attendants were a bit rough around the edges, wanted things to be done quickly. But some were more understanding and nice, but still have that edginess. That is all okay because they ended giving out some decent food. The problem I have with some airlines is that the food is just bland, and this is the same with United, but thankfully, they came with salt and pepper, good job. Dinner meals were okay, but breakfast was great. If your settling in for a long flight, try the omelette meal if they have it, the meal is rather delicious for airplane food. Cabin Staff Crew = 3/5 - Food And Beverages = 4/5. One thing I desperately have to mention is the washrooms in that airplane. I mean I had never seen anything like it. If your a person that frequently visits the washrooms, and does not like to wait, United might not be for you. On my flight, there was not a minute that the washroom was empty. There was also somebody in it, and there was also a lot of waiting, you couldn\u2019t just sit at your seat and wait for someone to finish, because they\u2019re people in line that will snatch that\u2019s opportunity up right away. Man the washrooms on that flight were something I will never forget. My last topic is in-flight entertainment. I felt the roster of movies was pretty good, and I got to watch some very good movies, that are brand new. The only downside is the technology to watch it. It was a touchscreen tv on the seat, but to be honest it was challenging to use, a light press on the screen when you want to exit out will not work at all, and you might be stuck with thinking that your screen isn\u2019t working and not watch a movie for the whole flight! But instead you had to press hard on every single button to get it to work. This is okay and is a lot better than the screen not working at all, but is frustrating. In-Flight Enternainment = 3/5 Well the flight was bearable, an above average flight as you can say, and above average is okay with me on a gruelling 10 hour flight but anything below that is a nightmare. Overall this flight was what you call plain mediocre. And if you have a bit of patience you\u2019ll get though it fine, and if you don\u2019t find another flight. Bearable, Above Average and Mediocre, are things that I feel itchy about, but for a 10 hour flight I would recommend it, but the price is a little bit out of hand."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "September 2018", "review": "\u2705 Trip Verified | I had a flight from Calgary to San Diego via San Francisco.

Now I'm stuck at Iceland without any clothes and can't get out in the cold weather. Here is the contrast, at the SFO airport, a gate agent of United, at the elite / premium line, was extremely rude. I hand over my passport and he handed back and said \"open to the photo page\". With 1 hour delay, and line up, and even at the premium line, this is United's attitude. And to compare to the agent of Lufthansa airlines at FRA airport gate, the 2 ladies was very friendly, and went out of their ways to help me, and put me on a same day flight connecting to Iceland only 5 hour later than my original flight. They didn't send me to the United customer service, which is what I would expect any gate agent or airline services in US airports would do.

The United Economy seat was very comfortable with heaps of legroom by economy standards. It is made of leather and reclines relatively far back.

The seat was also fully wired with a headphone jack, a USB port and a power outlet below the seat.

A few minutes later they announce that \"The Flight crew has arrived and they are waiting on the Jetway for paperwork.\" Another hour passes, and still no flight crew. At exactly 2 hours after closing the plane they open it again, this time to announce that since they don't have seats for the new flight crew (There was 2 Deadhead crew already on the plane) that they would have to trade out the flight crew now. (Why it took them 2 hours to make this decision I don't know) At this time a New Voice comes over the intercom announcing that \"If You are going to get off Plane do so Now.\" No explanation just a threatening voice, with no offer to re-book on another plane. Around 15 minutes later the captain (1st Crew) walks back into the cabin to explain what was going on and says that the new crew would be on the plane in a few minutes. Around 20 minutes later the new crew does arrive, and the Captain announces that as soon as they completed the inspection, and they had completed paper work we would be leaving, \"It should be about 20 minutes\".

First, dropping our checked bags at the Dublin airport took 50 minutes which I find ridiculous (thank goodness we arrived 3 hours early). The staff wasn't exactly efficient or in a hurry. Second, our flight was delayed 45 minutes to Newark. That's fine, delays happen, but when I tried asking a flight attendant if we were in jeopardy of missing our connection, it took 30 minutes for me to even flag someone down on the flight (even though my call light was on the whole time), and she was extremely rude and short. The flight attendants in general were less than friendly, especially when I asked if they had snacks for purchase and the attendant looked at me like I was dumb and said no. Got it. We finally arrive to our final destination in Raleigh and our bags did not arrive with us. We were informed they'd be on the next flight, but since we live three hours away, they said they would have them flown to Columbia, SC and would arrive Saturday night around 11pm, and then would be delivered to us.\u00a0 No big deal again, we get these things happen. Well, here we are Sunday at 10:00am, and the bags are nowhere to be found.\u00a0 It took me 30+ minutes to speak with someone in customer service and the language barrier is so bad, that I still don't know when our bags will arrive or why they didn't make the flight to Columbia last night. It\u2019s not the poor man\u2019s fault, sometimes it\u2019s just too difficult for both parties. I asked to speak to a supervisor but was told he was busy and would call me back (doubtful). I also called back and asked if I could speak with someone whose native language was English to avoid the language barrier and frustration (two attempts failed). They finally told me calls are globally routed and I'd have to keep calling until a native English speaker answered (30 min wait time each call). This goes far beyond things out of United\u2019s control happening, and today finally made me realize it\u2019s just terrible customer service.\u00a0 I am done making excuses for United and the people I have dealt with during my travels.\u00a0 No desire to travel on this airline again.

One of their rude staff members even told us our experience was the way it was (very very terrible) because we bought Basic Economy tickets. The staff from the DIA ticket counter to the gate were all unprofessional and rude. Our worst flight experience ever, and we've had many flights, was on this flight. This was the first time we bought a Basic Economy ticket, although unknowingly through a popular online reseller. So to start, we found out you only get one personal item and no small carry-on. Usually we have our small carry-on and personal item, which fit just fine under the seat with room to spare for our feet. Second, there is no online check-in, you will waste your time trying like I did. Third, when you go to the airport, numerous United signs tell you to use a kiosk to check in. That doesn't work either, as the kiosk instructs you to go to a ticketing agent to waste time. You have to look for a tiny little section off to the left that reads \"Economy\", where it is manned by a single representative. Fourth, once we got to the rude Economy ticketing agent, he pretended to not know why the kiosk rejected us so we had to show him. He quickly reminded us that we have the junk \"Basic Economy\" tickets. Then, we tried to hand our checked/labeled baggage to said rude agent since he had a scale one feet to his left, and he points to the other longer line and says \"it goes over there\". On to the bag line, the lady there was no better. She tells my wife in a rude tone (while also talking angrily to her coworkers), \"License and boarding pass!\" No \"hello\", no \"how are you\", not even a complete sentence, and they weren't even very busy so it surely couldn't have been that she was rushing or stressed out. After a very long security line wait with ultra slow TSA workers, we finally got to the gate and the door had just shut. This part was only partially United's fault due to lack of online check-in and their deceiving kiosk signs which wasted a good 30 minutes of precious time. The United gate agent was completely unprofessional and bitter and lacked any sympathy whatsoever. She kept telling me, in very stern fashion, to check my ticket next time as if I were new to flying. With a reluctant look on her face and body language, she got us onto a later flight. We lost our purchased seats, and my 8 year old was assigned a seat away from our group next to complete strangers.

Flying Economy Plus? Not sure, they have so many different levels depending on what a la cartes you picked! First the ticket agent in Chattanooga made me check my carry on and pay  $25.

Did file complaint with United and they have responded to my issue with a refund, so one plus for them. But, the agent, hopefully, will be reprimanded. It was dishonest to charge me and I did not realize till I boarded plane. Return flight, we got in early. They did not have bags in jetway as we deplaned! Instead, we waited 45 minutes after 11 PM for bags to enter carousel in baggage claim. Very exhausting that time of night. Why did they not make it convenient for us to grab as we got off plane?

Somehow United managed to turn from one of the best airlines in the US into the worst. Dated website and check-in portal that looks like it was developed in the 90s and has not been changed since then (especially the online check-in), non-transparent seating assignment for basic economy; I somehow end up at the very end of the plane almost every flight and sometimes separated from other family/friends on the same itinerary, despite early check-ins. Anyone from United can explain that? The airline has a low grade low-coster feel to it - old planes and dated looking everything. Did I mention the prices.... the ridiculous prices they charge for everything - even for basic economy airfare? Well there is a flex-economy, and a premium economy, and maybe an economy plus and economy XL to be added sometimes soon, but don't be optimistic with the names of tariffs. The price for airfare is ridiculously expensive, especially if you are based in Houston and out of luck as you don't have access to other airlines (United must be lobbying this very hard). Even the most basic economy option is way too expensive for domestic flights, especially if you want to pack up a swimming suite with you in a small suitcase as there comes the baggage fees, extra baggage fees if you take your small checked suitcase on board, pay if you want to sit next to the isle or window, or your family member, pay for obsolete entertainment options: lack of free wifi yet extremely slow if you finally decide to swipe your card for it. My favorite - pay if you want to watch Direct-TV on a contrast lacking micro-screen in front of you - a paid streaming TV on board of a plane - You. Must. Be. Kidding. Me! Culmination of this \"entertainment\" system happened on my recent night flight from Houston to Miami. The system glitched completely and was stuck in startup loop during the whole flight blasting that 100% brightness Direct-TV logo on and off (in my face!) the whole night without possibility to turn that screen off. Now to the meals and snacks! - What snacks!? - Ah the mini-pretzels and and that is it. At least soda and the lavatories are free for now! I have flown many airlines, and can confidently say that Easyjet, Southwest, AA and Delta are all better airlines then United, by all means - price, comfort, entertainment, convenience and transparency and fairness to its clients. How come I am able to fly between Miami, Vegas, LA and NY for 200-300$ with other airlines but it costs me at least 300$ to fly to the nearest major destination out of Houston, which most of the time is half the distance of the above-mentioned flights? How come low-costers in Europe can get you from Norway to Spain round-trip for 100$ while this behemoth is crying going out of business if they lower the prices. Unfortunately I am currently based in Houston and don't have much access to other airlines due to long lasting monopoly of this company on the local market so have to unwillingly stick to it. On the positive side I can mention ground and cabin crew. These folks are always welcoming.

When it was getting close to the time that we would need to start boarding, we walked over to the gate and found out that the flight left at its scheduled time. No updates, no announcement for boarding, nothing. The woman at the gate laughed it off saying that when the pilot wants to leave the pilot leaves. With no more flights leaving from Tucson that day on United, we were infuriated. The woman was not empathetic, wouldn\u2019t look us in the eyes, and gave us no other options but to stay in Tucson (not comped by United, mind you) and arrive to Cleveland at 3pm the next day. We called the customer service line and the representative literally said \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you weren\u2019t at your gate, you should have been there\u201d. After he also unempathetically didn\u2019t even try to help us, I asked to speak to a manager. I\u2019m pretty sure I spoke to the same guy who just changed his voice into a higher pitched tone. He said the same and wouldn\u2019t even give me a refund, gave me a hard time about missing the flight and said that he knows that they make courtesy announcements before taking off. Apparently you don\u2019t, or I wouldn\u2019t have been stranded in Tucson.

I have never had my seating changed by any airline after choosing a seating assignment if they \"cant be guaranteed\" there is no advantage flying United over Southwest aside from paying more money. They had availability to accommodate to economy plus but of course wanted more money. we had to change flights adding a 4 hour layover and pickup arrangements just to sit next to each other. No wonder United ranks so poorly in customer service. I will avoid flying this airline at all costs in the future, its more important to try and suck another $300 out of a customer than accommodate and make it right. I will also be canceling my United Plus card as it serves no benefits. It does us no good to travel together if only one person on the card gets priority. I was on the phone for over an hour and 30 min with costumer service that is a joke.

Airline travel is hard enough without punitive agents. On March 31 we were making a coast-to-coast trip after our cruise. Our return tickets from Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City were with United purchased through Expedia. Our day started at 4 am. Most airlines that I know of allow a carry on and a personal item policy. We chose the United flight because it got us back at a decent hour so we could make the 3.5-hour drive back to our home in Idaho. We had tried to print our boarding passes online with the ship\u2019s computer/printer but were unable to with the directive we would have to see an agent at the airport. We were informed, when were arrived at the airport, that we would have to check our carry on bags because of the nature of the ticket we purchased. We weren't happy about it but did so at the extra cost of $25 a bag. We had purchased a basic economy flight ticket so that did not allow a carry on. We were placed in the very back row 38 and had a bumpy and straight-backed ride for over 6 hours. Fair enough. On arriving at San Francisco for our transfer flight of an hour and a half to SLC we had something to eat and waited. We were the last passengers to board the plane. As we were being checked in the United Agent stopped my wife. He/she said the carry on bag of my wife needed to be checked even though we had just gotten off a United jet of the same size and model so there was no question that it fit under the seat and that is the criteria that was listed by Expedia and United: \u201cCarry-on bags are limited to one personal item that fits under the seat in front of you.\u201d I have to interject here that my wife has used this same personal carry on bag for over 20 years of flying with all the major airlines United, Delta, American, Alaskan, and Frontier. No airline agent of flight attendant had ever given her a problem because of its size or dimensions (9x9x18). It always fit easily under the seat, even with the small computer planes that have much shorter routes with much smaller jets. My wife was forced to give up her personal bag before she could board the flight. My wife sent me on to board since my protests were falling on deaf ears. But after taking about 10 steps I turned around and went back to ask the agent if this had anything to do with the ticket we had purchased through Expedia? She/he said yes. So I went to board. My wife boarded about 3-5 minutes later and when she reached our back seats she was seething. She told me to guess what they had charged her to check her personal bag. I guessed $25? No. $50? No. She was charged $175.00! She told me she had felt bullied and belittled by what took place. This whole experience has soured us both towards flying with United Airlines.

The manager comes out and tells them that \"it will be fine and just keep printing them.\" The Rep hands the vouchers to us and away we go. We wait in line for the shuttle then wait in line for the Westin service desk only to find out the vouchers do not work since there is no credit card associated with them or no established account with the Westin!!! After waiting to get on the phone with one of the United service reps at Dulles, the rep tells us we must go back to the airport to pick up a new voucher with a number! Fortunately Westin knows how to provide Customer service and convinces the United Rep at Dulles to just send over some form via email and puts us up even without a payment method. This negotiation lasted two hours. At this point we have been traveling for 11 hours with only 1 hour in flight. Also none of our food vouchers work at the hotel for the same reason.

Confused, I asked why. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong seat\u201d, in a rude and urgent tone. I explained to her that I would need to look through my emails to find my original boarding pass. She was rushing me, told me she needed to board all other passengers, and that I needed to hurry up even though she just told me to do this. I showed her my pass from the first leg of the flight. This made her even more on edge and provoked since it was not the right pass. I then found the pass for the current flight and showed it to her. She condescendingly asking, \u201cAnd this is for the flight now?\u201d, as she refused to read the pass for herself. I said yes and continued to point to the seats me and my friend were assigned listed on the pass. Without reading the pass at all she pointed to my seat and said, \u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong seat. You need to move, you\u2019re in the wrong seat\u201d. She was unfriendly, unrelenting, and very angry at me. A man sitting at the window spoke up and said that he was actually in the wrong seat and it was his fault. The passenger that originally asked for help from to the flight attendant, was at this point, visibly uncomfortable by how the flight attendant was harassing nearby passengers and said it didn\u2019t matter where he sat he didn\u2019t care anymore. I ultimately was in the right seat the entire time. However, I was the only passenger the attendant interrogated rudely and angrily. She did not apologize and looked extremely annoyed after this all occurred. Scared that I would be kicked off the plane if I spoke up, I left without receiving any apology from her what so ever. I felt nervous, uncomfortable, upset, and victimized. Later in the flight, another attendant walked up to my seat. She yelled at me to put my seat fully up, two times in a row. I was shocked because I had never put my seat down in the first place. I looked up at her and she said this to me again while telling me to press the button to put the seat up. I pressed the button and the seat didn\u2019t move at all because it was always fully straight. I said to her, \u201cIt is fully up\u201d. She said extremely shortly, \u201cI am allowed to tell you to put it up. That is my job.\u201d Then proceeded to glare at me. I said \u201cthat\u2019s fine\u201d. And she rolled her eyes at me. She did not treat any other passengers on board like this except for me. I felt treated unfairly and felt like I could not speak up or I\u2019d be dragged off the plane.

They have about three different classes of ticket for the passengers who are all sitting in the same section on the plane. And they treat those who has a Basic Economy ticket like farm animals. If not, worse. You have to pay wifi, pay if you want a tiny bag of food, pay to check a bag that should be carry on, and all while they not caring about you at all. They have older planes, the ones that other airlines retired years ago, so they're excessively cramped, and dirty, and little things on the seats and in the aisles are broken or falling all.

Airlines like Singapore pay attention to every detail, such as the check-in staff. United falls short every here and there. After the mergers, United has monopolized tons of routes, so now they make money off of the monopoly and don't care about service quality whatsoever. Will not fly them other than on exclusive routes."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "January 2018", "review": "\u2705 Trip Verified | Grand Rapids to Newark. I had a bad feeling when I booked with United but as this was for a job interview and I was asked to fly out in three days, I didn't have any other choice but to take whatever flights were available - my original sense of dread turned out to be justified and I certainly will not be flying with United again. The flight was scheduled to take off at 7:30 PM, it's 9:38 PM and I'm still here. Initially, they announced a 3 hour delay, then, figuring that wasn't inconvenient enough, they changed it to 4 hours. So instead of arriving at my destination at 9:30 PM as I was originally scheduled to do so, I will be getting in at 1:40 AM - no big deal. And of course the United employees at the kiosk make it quite clear through their laissez faire attitude, and at times downright rude behavior, that they really don't care about the fact that paying customers are waiting out a 4 hour delay. It's very obvious United doesn't give any thought to customer service. When asked what the issue is, they respond with \"Oh, the plane is undergoing maintenance.\" Funny, I figured maintenance would be done routinely, not when it has the potential to ruin as many lives as possible. And, shouldn't there maybe be a backup plan? Is every single United plane currently being used with no consideration given to the possibility of unforeseen mishaps like this? I especially like the response I received from the snooty United employee when I asked if there were any other flights available - \"No, probably not...\" Probably not? Umm, do you mind checking perhaps? Which she begrudgingly did after I asked. Real problem solvers they got there. I'm also really glad I signed up for both their email and text message alerts regarding flight changes. I received neither. I'm sure they just didn't want to fill up my inbox or use up my monthly text message allowance. I suppose United figured this was the best way to earn back some respect. Nice job guys, this will certainly be my last flight with this airline. United has steadily been losing credibility amongst my circle of professional colleagues, and it's not difficult to see why."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "January 2018", "review": "\u2705 Trip Verified |  This was a very pleasant weekend excursion to celebrate my birthday.

On the IAD-TPA segment, the whole exit row was open, but I was upgraded to an aisle seat in first class.

My flight BOS-EWR was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft and I had a short connection in EWR to continue towards HKG. The customer service is unhelpful, as if the delay is your fault, not theirs. They refused to board me on an earlier flight, they could not offer re-routing nor sponsor the ticket with another airline to secure my journey. The delay was ultimately tight for my connection, but every UA representative I spoke to suggested the other flight would have likely waited. It did not. It left six minutes earlier than scheduled. Despite asking to the flight attendants while on flight whether my connection would have waited, the response was that United - differently from every other Star Alliance company - does not offer this \"service\". I landed and there was no representative to direct delayed passengers. I rushed to the gate to make the unpleasant discovery that my connection departed earlier. I thus went for the customer service. I stood on a line for 3h and 15m. Around 45 minutes after landing, a text message invited me to check-in for my next flight, from which I derived I was booked for the same flight the following day. After hours of waiting, I reached a representative that handed me a voucher for the hotel and US$ 30 for three meals: yes, $ 10 per meal. Not to mention, the hotel was sketchy and sub-standard. The flights were possibly the worst I have ever experienced in 14 years of flying. In over 16h flight (plus boarding, taxing, etc.) they serve two microscopic meals and one snack. No snacks in the galley. Never seen such misery. The crew was confrontational at all stages. They said: \"We are nice to people who are nice to us\", which is reasonable in abstract, but they seem to forget we are not fellow travellers! I am the customer, they are the flight attendants. As I have reached my final destination over 25h later than initially scheduled, I sought compensation from United. Unsurprisingly, their customer service is dismissive. I was told I can buy insurance next time. I do have insurance, but they cover unforeseeable events, not negligence of the carrier. I have been trying to hold them liable under the Montreal Convention, but so far all they offer are pointless vouchers in the illusion that I would ever subject myself again to the pain of dealing with such an unpleasant, unprofessional, unapologetic company. United airlines punishes you for making the unwise choice of traveling with them. Despite you pay for a service, they drop on you the cost of their inefficiency. Leaving aside old aircrafts, primitive forms of IFE that have disappeared in the rest of the world, broken controls, dirty and hard seats, meals that not even if you live out stamps. The point is the lack of consideration, the way they treat a paying customer at every stage of the experience, from check in to customer service when you try to claim damages for the disservice they caused you. Finally, UA cheats selling tickets with connecting time they cannot really respect or guarantee. They are cheating to rank higher on search engines with prices and journey duration. On any international flight, make sure you have 2.5h connecting time minimum. Few reviews will tell you UA is less worse than they say: don't gamble with it.

I had a bad experience with them in the past, but this was the only flight returning to Seattle from Fresno that I could find. Both flights (my flight to SFO, and the connecting flight from SFO to SEA) were delayed at least an hour, if not more. In SFO we were supposed to leave at 8.40pm, but were delayed. However, we still boarded even more passengers, and were told we would be taking off at 9.10pm. But, because we continued boarding we didn't leave the ground until after 9.30pm. No explanation was made by the captain or the flight crew, but there we sat, waiting and waiting and waiting. The flight was hot and stuffy. I also was incredibly annoyed with the baggage policy. When I booked my flight, there was no communication that I couldn't bring a carry on bag. As this was a very short trip, I brought just a carry on and my personal item. But when I checked in, I was informed I couldn't have one and needed to have it checked, for an additional $25, and that I couldn't even check it at the gate. I've never in my life, been told this before. I literally had to rethink everything I packed and how I packed it, as I had a layover and needed to do homework. When I got to the United booth at FAT to drop off my now checked bag, there was no one there, and the other customer and I waited ten minutes for them to return, again with no explanations. The kicker was when I got to the gate and everyone who had a carry-on bags was given a tag (no additional charge) for their tagged bag! Coupled with so many other things that went wrong today, having a horrible flight experience was the worst thing that could have happened. So take heed, if you fly Basic Economy, you have to a) pay a $25 checked bag for an otherwise acceptable carry-on bag on any other airline, and b) if you fail to check the bag there is an additional $25 fee on top of the checked bag fee if you check it at the gate.

The flight to LAX was initially announced as being on time, but 10 minutes after boarding should have commenced, a delay of boarding has been announced due to a maintenance issue (change of tire), but still no official delay has been announced. This is especially irritating as UA\u2019s boarding procedure requires all passengers (including children, First Class and Priority) to line up in 5 different queues according to boarding groups like applicants for a free handout before boarding starts.

In the past, if you\u2019d book a coach seat, you would have a carry-on and a check-in bag included, and if you had an extra bag, it was still ok, no extra fee. You would get a free meal, and the entertainment, although it was on the minimalist side (because technology was not what it is today), was properly working (at least, most of the time). Not anymore. Today, well, where do I start? You book a basic economy seat for a price that is proportionally the same as for an economy flight in the past, and you have to pay for virtually every single thing on top of that. Only one small item allowed with you on the plane (I guess United figured that you might need a pair of extra underwear and socks if you go to the other side of the country) and they will give you a hard time if you bring a second one (like your camera bag, for instance). Which means that, if you bring a small item with you, along with a luggage of carry-on size, they will ask you to check that luggage in and you will have to pay a $25 fee. If you have an actual check-in luggage on top, that will be considered second check-in luggage, an extra $35. If you book a round trip, that\u2019s already an extra $120 on top of your ticket price. Now, note that I am traveling alone. Imagine being in that situation with a family. Once you are on the plane, no meal other than the usual boring pretzels and a glass of cheap soda or juice. Prices for extra food/drinks are, of course, comfortably marked-up (food and drinks that are of questionable quality). I\u2019m not even mentioning the ever missing extra blankets despite the still totally dysfunctional temperature management on the plane. Now, moving onto the entertainment part: extraordinarily, United has managed to make the ticket payer, use your own electronic devices and ear sets, so they can save thousands of dollars by not having to build-in an entertainment system for your plane section. How amazingly smart is that? Instead, they royally connect you to their internal server (of course, if you want real internet, it\u2019s extra. And not cheap) and allow you to download a ridiculously impractical software plug-in that, if you ever finally manage to download and use it, turns out to be the worst piece of garbage I\u2019ve ever used on a plane to watch a movie. I eventually had to stop the experience. You simply can\u2019t deal with a movie that is so chopped up by the constant disconnections from the server that it becomes literally unwatchable. By the way, absolutely zero electric or USB plug anywhere around your seat to recharge your devices. Only in selective rows. So, what comes next, United? Paying to use the toilets on the plane? Charging a fee to bring our own device? Another fee to have a reclining seat? Where does it end? How much money can you still manage to save on the back of the customer? Lately, almost every single time I took a United flight, I felt they were simply trying to squeeze every dollar out of the customer. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the plane. Yes, you can always say other companies pull their own tricks on customers, that you have expenses, that the market is bad, etc. I travel all over the world, and many companies that belong to so-called \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d are better than United Airlines and treat their customers better than they do.

They are not when you consider the grab for further dollars one experiences at the airport kiosk by attendants stationed there for no other reason than to hold one's boarding pass hostage until they can very strictly put one through a bag measurement process almost certainly designed to fail most bags. When I made my airline selection for this trip, I had three acceptable airline choices for what seemed to be comparable economy fares, with similar measurement maximums for one's allowable personal item. I selected United for no other reason than their fare and bag seemed to match the others, but I liked the flight time slightly better. I could have just as easily chosen either of the other two airlines. Had I known the ugliness and embarrassment that they cause me in front of my daughter due to their extortion of further funds at the kiosk, I would certainly have chosen one of the other two. United seems to continually hate and disrespect their customers with policies and procedures designed to humiliate them for needing to fly on a budget due either to family or other commitments. When I left home, I carefully measured both my and my 11 year old daughter's personal items. Aside from the wheels on her very small child's size suitcase, both items fit the measurements. I put my purse inside my personal item, such that between the two of us we had exactly two items. The Basic Economy fare does not allow one to check in online before getting to the airport. One is forced to print one's boarding pass at the airport kiosk. When one arrives at the kiosk, one cannot complete the boarding pass process with having an attendant approve final printing of the pass by checking the size of the personal item, then scanning his/her badge to unlock the system. The attendant had no problem with our personal items when we left our home airport. We arrived at our destination without incident. United immediately sent me an option to review my leaving flight, but I wanted to wait until we returned home. Returning home from Dallas international airport a few days later was a completely different story. I had to get up in the middle of the night to return our rental car and make a 6am flight. When we arrived at the kiosk, the attendant put us through a rigorous bag measuring process. A zipper on my personal item kept catching on the metal, but I was able to get the bag into the box. I was very tired from having gotten up in the middle of the night, and forgot to put my purse into my personal item. I had to struggle to stuff it in at the last minute. My daughter's very small suitcase fit exactly, except for the small wheels. The suitcase fit with plenty of room to spare on the way to Dallas. The kiosk attendant stated that the measurement requirements had nothing to do with whether or not the item fit under the seat, meaning they were in place solely as a justification to get more money. Once I paid for the bag, the attendant didn't even finish printing our boarding passes. I had to get another attendant to finish printing them. The attendants are there for no other purpose than to collect more money by scrupulously measuring bags. They are not there for any benefit to the customer whatsoever.

Having flowing in and out of McCarran International Airport quite frequently on early morning flights, I knew that I should be able to move through things fairly quickly. I arrived at the airport at 5:05 AM. I went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass and was stopped. United Airlines employees told me that I was too late to get on my 5:50 AM flight, and that I would have to wait in the ticketing line to rebook my flight. I kept trying to explain to them that at I still had over forty-five minutes until my flight left and that I wasn't checking any baggage, but they wouldn't listen to me. Instead, they forced me to stand in a ticketing line for 20 minutes by which point it really was too late for me to make the flight. When I got to the counter the woman rebooking me acted as though I was checking my back. When I explained that I wasn't, she got what can only be described as an \"oh no\" look on her face. Then, she very apologetically explained to me that a mistake had been made, and that I should have been permitted to pass through and get on the flight. Apparently, despite having tried to explain the exact same thing multiple times to the other employees they chose to stop me anyway. I had missed the cut off for passengers trying to check luggage (45 mins) but not for people just trying to print their boarding pass and go straight through to the flight (30 mins).

Well, she ended up getting us to Denver (our other connection) on separate flights and we rented a car for a day and drove 9 hours to Yellowstone. On our flight back, we had the same flight pattern. Our first flight from Cody was delayed 4 hours due to mechanical errors, causing us to miss the rest of our flights for the day. However, they did get us a hotel in Denver and some meal comp tickets, which I was very grateful for. But why couldn't they do this on the way there?

Originally our route was supposed to be Seattle - Chicago - Norfolk, but a day or two before our flight United changed the route to go through Newark instead. We arrived in Newark with no mishaps and when we went to a United counter to see what gate our connecting flight was leaving from, we were told that flight had been cancelled, but no reason was given. Instead, we were directed to a customer service counter with a very long line and only two agents assisting customers. Come to find out, United cancelled several flights from Newark that day. After standing in line for almost two hours (while also trying to talk to a person on the United hotline number while in line and receiving no help), it was finally my turn to speak to a desk agent. The agent was no help at all, and told me the flight had been cancelled due to weather, and since it was a weather issue, he told me United was not responsible to help with lodging, rental cars, etc. The soonest we could be booked on another flight was the following Monday, July 3. His solution was my family of four was welcome to remain in the airport throughout the weekend. That being an unacceptable option we, and apparently every other United customer affected by cancellations, went to rent a car and finally found a car available to drive to Norfolk. After cancelling our flight, the best they can offer is for us to stay in the airport for two nights and three days? No offer to reimburse, no offer to help with the rental, not offer to reimburse baggage fees. Not even some empathy form the agent. Not flying United again.

All this in mind and I was not eager to fly.

The seat was made out of this leather with detailed stitching patterns and a tag on the side that had the United logo on it and it had a cool color scheme to it too. Not only did it look good but it felt fairly comfortable for a small seat and the cushioning was decent. Legroom was also tolerable and take my word for it because I have very long legs. The seats didn't have those necessary in-flight entertainment screens but all seats were installed with a tablet/device holder so you can comfortably watch free entertainment on your personal device via the United wifi.

It felt like a long-haul budget carrier flight! Of course, there was a full drink service. If you wanted to eat, you had to order from the menu a wide selection of hot meals that costed upwards $10.

My mom has been working for United for over 28 years so when I fly I use her buddy passes. Using her buddy passes this means that I fly standby (which means I only get a seat if one is available). I decided to fly home for the weekend so I decided to fly from Detroit airport to Newark on June 23rd. There were about 15-20 open seats on this flight so I knew there should be no problem getting on the flight. There were a few delays due to air traffic control and that is normal and expected on a busy day like Friday. After waiting a few hours in delays, it was finally time for my flight to board. I stood right by the podium as I waited for everyone to board and once they finished I went right up the front desk to ask if any stand bys have been called yet. The lady said she wasn't sure and that she had to wait for one of the other agents to come back because she would have the answer. I waited about 5-10 minutes for the other agent to go back and I nervously kept looking at the screen to make sure that I didn't miss my name being called but the screen still said \"Boarding\" and my name was not checked off the screen yet despite all of the empty seats. The United agent finally returned and when I asked her about the stand by's she had nothing to say to me. All she said was that the doors were already closed and that I would not be making it on the flight. I did not understand what she was saying because there were no announcements made AT ALL about final boarding. Not only did the agent forget to call the whole stand by list, she never announced that boarding was coming to an end. Before the flight even began boarding, I specifically went up to the Agents and told them I was flying stand by and I asked them if they would be calling out my name so that I could receive my ticket. They assured me they would call me once everyone else was boarded. However, this was not the case at all. While this whole ordeal was happening, I was talking to my mom on the phone who told me that she never has seen something like this in her 28 years of flying. She was very upset by this as was I and instructed me to see if there was something else I could talk to. When I asked the lady if I could talk to someone else about this problem, she told me there was nobody else I could talk to about this issue. The lady then began to ignore me when I continued to talk to her about this problem. I was absolutely baffled on how an airline could just get away without giving a final boarding call for a flight. There was also another person on stand by who missed out on this flight because the agents never made the proper announcements. This was the last flight out for the day so it caused me to be stuck in Detroit for the night when this never should have happened considering there were over 15 seats open. Not only did the lady refuse to help or even tell me what happened, she failed to do one of her basic duties as an agent - which is make the proper announcements.

There was one who was very sarcastic and rude to a passenger and another who was not knowledgeable of the food she was serving. The food portions were rather small compared to a domestic trans-con flight. For dinner, they served chicken rice or pasta with a roll and a cup of salad, and vanilla ice cream.  In the middle of the flight, they served snacks. Ice-cold ham & cheese sandwich with Asian-style trail mix and a chocolate. The sandwich was terrible. I gave praise to the crew walking around the cabin giving away water in between meal times. Then before landing, breakfast. Cheese omelet with a \"rubber\" sausage and hashbrowns or this Japanese chicken rice with this bourbon cookie. The crew was not very presentable and mediocre, some of the crew looked like they just lazily put on their uniform without a care of how they looked. There were only two crew who had a smile on their face the whole flight. Some had the expression of regret for choosing their career as a flight attendant, some were just tired and wanted to go back to the crew rest, and some had great poise.

This made us 45 minutes and 35 minutes late these two examples. One of these examples, I missed my connecting flight. Had to sprint to connecting flight on the other. 2 x flight crew members didn't show up for work - one 1.5 hour delay and one flight cancelled (after several hours) and had to stay overnight in Houston. Was forced to pay for most of hotel room. Luckily I was first in line to get rebooked the next morning and was also able to get an airport hotel room. Others were not so lucky 2 x sensor failures - On two separate trips had to return to gate after pushing off, one time there was no immediate gate and had to wait on tarmac for over an hour. Another time, plane was taken off service and we waited for several hours for a replacement. 2 x late planes \u2013 Planes didn\u2019t arrive on time (not weather-related) and once we took off and landed at connecting airport, I had to run from terminal to terminal to make connection. Most other passengers doing the same connection did not make it. On the positive side, I will say that my status does help me solve many other problems that come up (some weather-related, some not), but for non-status passengers, those other situations would have been horrific.

I of course was in group 5, therefore I was disqualified. Although I saved money purchasing a ticket via priceline.com, in the end United made that money back by forcing me pay for my carry on bag.

My daughter preferred to wait until the 12:30pm flight just to avoid the gate agents. A simple, caring, clear communication from the gate agents would have avoided a lot of anxiety, anger, and tears.

That is not the case here, or at least I did not find them - so the storage has to be done in the overhead bins. Besides the very comfortable oversized pillow, United also provides you with two blankets, a regular one, and a slightly heavier quilted one. I initially used the quilted one, but since the temperature in the cabin was quite comfortable I eventually gave up on both. The food is a little lacking, for the first course, I chose the Halibut which was very good but second meal was a very dry and flavorless piece of chicken breast. This, in my opinion, is a problem, primarily because it is served an hour before landing and sticks in people's memories as their meal experience. The service while professional is not on par with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. While I cannot put my finger on it simply lacks the elegance and savoir-faire of their counterparts. Another big issue is the entertainment, while there is an excellent selection I cannot for the life of me understand why I constantly have to be subjected to Barracuda and Marriott advertising - it is not just once, but after every single show that I want to watch. This really cheapens the United brand, if you want to do it on the domestic legs to offset the entertainment costs the so be it - but to do it on the international leg in business class is unheard of. United is definitely on to something with Polaris, with a little fine tuning this could become a Business Class for others to follow."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "May 2017", "review": "\u2705 Verified Review |  \r\nFlew United Airlines from Sydney to San Francisco.

Having read the glorious PR about their new \"chef,\" I was really looking forward to the food. I wouldn't serve it in Economy and they ran out of the Chicken dish by the time they got to me.

Our complaint is that our flight group wasn't offered a \"return\" trip on that bus down to where the plane was residing (and wound up spending the night on the tarmac) at Grand Junction Reg Airport. No, we were all told - in spite of the inclement weather with promise of more to come - to \"come back early tomorrow morning; that plane will surely be able to get in here for you.\" Doubting this, we nonetheless secured an (expensive) one night unplanned additional stay nearby, awoke at 3:30 am Sunday, and got a ride back down to the still socked-in airport. Our intended plane went ahead and left Grand Junction not to come get us (it couldn't), but to head off to parts unknown. The weather was such that no plane wasn't getting in and the bus, was long gone. The bus that could have easily transported our departing group down to the plane in its nearby diverted location the day before.

Thank you so much, Hertz! 14 hours and $500.00 later (between the +1 night and rental car), United was out of our hair. The United gate agents seemed quite genuinely to not care a wit about the departing passenger's situations and needs. United bused the newly arriving folks in from the \"detour airport\", allowing that bus to subsequently dead-head off to who knows where.

I was given access to the United First Class lounge which was located closer to the boarding area of the flight. The Business Class section was 2x2x2 seating, causing window passengers to cross over their seat mates. The service was excellent and the food and wines were good, however, I did not get my first choice, fish. So much for ordering the white wine and ending up with beef. My main complaint was that the fasten seatbelt sign came on at least 12 times during the flight and it was a smooth flight. Several times one little bump would cause the fasten seatbelt sign to appear, which would trigger the recorded announcement, \"Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. For your safety and for those around you, please return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt.\" A flight attendant would then do the message in Chinese. The television monitors (many which were turned off) would all turn back on and with a bright white background with the message a special announcement is in progress. This certainly lit up the entire cabin. I would strongly recommend that if you fly on United's 787 aircraft, you bring good earplugs and eye shades. In short, United is not a good airline if you want to sleep on the flight. This was a smooth flight and the flight attendants were never asked to sit down but I was woke up many times during the flight.

When I asked if he had any gluten free options, he said \"I can't tell you if it's gluten free but you can look in the menu and try to buy something.\" He couldn't be bothered with telling me the other options he had in his cart. When I looked at the menu the only completely gluten free option offered was a small bag of popcorn that costs almost $6. I asked the other flight attendant if there were any snacks like bananas, \"kind\" trailmix bars, or baked potato chips in the front of the plane. Her response was \"I don't know but the snacks for up front are you know, for up front.\" So instead of sacrificing one snack item from the front of the plane that probably costs less than a dollar in actuality, both attendants left me with no food for the duration of the flight. I flew with Delta last week and they were much more accommodating and pleasant. While they did not have gluten free snacks in economy either, the attendants did manage to find a banana and a \"kind\" bar for me in \"the front\" of the plane, after I only mentioned my gluten intolerance to them once. In comparison, Deltas entertainment system is also far more superior to United's. The only positive thing I can say about this trip with United is that my neighbor (after buying an hour of wifi for $8) did mention that the wifi connection was good.

United did me a \"favor\" by booking me another connection flight with a 7 hour layover. I needed to be home that day but instead I get to waste 7 hours of my day in an airport. What makes this even worse is the fact that they did not compensate any of the passengers on the plane. Fast forward and it's the next morning. You get up at 5 am and drive to the airport and get on the plane. The plane arrives at an airport where your connection is. Time is getting closer to the departure time and then it happens. The flight is delayed once again. This time it's for 3 hours (keep in mind I needed to be home a whole day ago). Now they apologize and say they can't do anything about it.

We then tried for 6 hours to get onto standby flight in IAH but we're unable to, a fault of none. Busy travel days and large airports make for difficult travelling for everyone. The food or the seats on the plane weren't really a problem either seeing as it should be expected that airlines are a pay to play service. Customer service, however, was unbelievable. We were lied to, ignored, spoken to rudely. Customer service lines took 3 hours to get to the front of and there was no noticeable attempt to fix it. However, not all of the customer service has been bad. The man who booked us our first two flights moved heaven and earth to re-book our first flight, and then get us another flight, with great difficulty, that same day. Besides him however, the United staff has been egregious.

And once again after paying for the cabs and reaching there on time we found that the flight is delayed by 4 hours. I felt deceived. I spoke to an attendant as to why I was not informed about the delay and she told I will get back to me in a moment and went on serving the customers at other kiosk without ever bothering to respond me. I then waited for 15 minutes to speak with another one and she asked how I made my resevation and I explained her it was through Priceline. And she tried to blame them as it is their fault and they have to inform me. I told her that these were new boarding passes which were issued by United Airlines at the kiosk. Her response \"Yeah right. I dont know\". I told her it is not a problem if there is a delay but it is your responsibility to inform me so that I would not have come early. Her response, \"I know but i cant do anything. You could wait at the airport or leave and then come back at around 9.30 am as that is when the boarding starts\". Is she going to pay us for the cabs? Cant they see what efforts we might have gone through to come to airport in the icy conditions with heavy luggage? She then tried to blame the weather when I told her the flight to and from the same locations in Southwest is running at scheduled time. Then she said, \"I don't control anything here.

On top of the $200 United already wanted me to pay, they were going to charge me an additional $200 to change the flight, $100 to book the flight through United and not a travel agent. In essence, I would actually be paying United close to the $561 credit owed to me for a $170 flight. Additionally, I spoke with three agents and all of them were rude and disrespectful. I was hung up on twice and the first person I spoke with could not speak English. I'm stunned that I have to pay to use a credit owed to me.

My flight was at 9:55, my friend and I were waiting at the gate (the gate listed on United's app which was verified by the employee's of the airport). At 10:00 we are looking at each other wondering why boarding or no announcements were made on the PA system. We go to customer service to find out that they made a last minute gate change (this happens often in airports and I've never had a problem catching flights using the App or listening to PA system). We were told we could be put on standby for the last flight that evening or have seats for an 8am flight the next day. Due to the fact that the gate change was not announced or alerted through the app we were not the only passengers having this problem. We later realized that they never made the announcement because they have over booked multiple flights and needed extra seats! After we were not able to get on our standby flight - due to overbooking, they asked for volunteers to give up their seats to be able to fit other passengers- We had to sleep in the airport (we asked for hotel accommodation and were told we would be reimbursed however the \"volunteers\" got vouchers right away). After sleeping in the freezing cold airport and finally boarding our flight, while giving our boarding passes we were told our reservation was canceled! The look of complete shock and anger was extremely difficult to hide and the customer service/flight attendant informed me that, \"If I wanted them to help us I would have to remove my attitude\"! I did not even utter a word out of my mouth towards them to be met with such a comment? I let them know that it was their job to help me and no one was doing any favor's here. How appalling to have missed your flight, through no fault of your own and to be tossed around being reassured your tickets were confirmed and that everything was going to be okay only to be served with sass?! Mind you the entire customer service experience from since we missed our flight was horrible. Everyone had an attitude and blamed the passengers for their experience. I've never had this kind of experience when I've paid for a service/goods. My recommendation would be to give customer service and flight attendants courses on how to deal with customers.

Luckily our trip other than United was amazing but I would not get on another flight from this company even if it was half the price of its competitors. I cannot really come up with a good point from the company except price and its partners airlines. Breakdown of review categories: Value for money is lowest possible because I don't find any value in their service. The price was good for our flight if they met any expectation but failed in all categories. Ground and Air Service were both rude and I would have given the air service one star if it wasn't for the ground service being significantly worse comparably. Seat comfort was normal for an American airline company but still far behind all foreign flight companies I have flown with. Beverages and food options are a bare minimum. There was pretty much no inflight entertainment with a couple of movies (at least this was free because of the many mistakes and delays they had already caused but normally very overpriced and outdated.) I hate knowing that when I book with ANA (my favorite airline) I have a chance to be stuck with flights from this company and may switch my primary airline to avoid this.

Air traffic control delays at Bogota meant a 25 minute delay arriving into Houston. This flight was operated with a Boeing 737-700 and was packed. Cabin crew were ok if not somewhat lackadaisical. Perhaps it was the midnight departure. Announcements were barely audible. For inflight entertainment, this plane was equipped with DirectTV rather than the airline's far superior wifi delivered personal device entertainment. This meant having to pay to view the only 8 movies available - as the rest of DirectTV's content library is inaccessible outside the continental USA. Big Fail. The cabin was uncomfortably warm throughout the flight and coupled with the older seats, tight pitch and full load made it far less pleasant and also difficult to catch any shut eye. Strangely, a full meal is served on this sector at about 1.30am, which to be honest, wasn't bad. Made me wonder why our outbound to Panama from Newark of a similar duration and more appropriate departure time for a meal service, offered no complimentary catering. The crew did a few water runs until arrival in Houston. Transfer at Houston took longer than I expected owing to slow immigration clearance. However, I boarded the next flight with ample time to settle in. This aircraft was a Boeing 737-900ER with the newer seats, sky interior and wifi delivered entertainment. What a difference. It just felt more spacious. Seats were a bit more comfortable and legroom seemed to be better. Perception is everything I guess. The crew this time were sunnier, cheerful and seemed pleased to be onboard. Pushback was right on time and arrival 18 minutes early. Service consisted of the usual morning beverages and a stroopwaffel. A second round of coffees and a couple of water runs were done as well. All with a smile. This last flight was clearly the best of 3 I took with United over the last 10 days. Pity both the shorter international sectors I experienced were not quite up to scratch and felt more like domestic runs.

In terms of full-blown, memorable personalised service, it probably is a little below the level of other airlines. Also, there's some cost cutting aspects which became apparent after a while. I asked for another bowl of nuts some way into the flight and was told \"We're out of nuts.\" I asked for a snack and was told that they put out sandwiches and snacks, but only at the half-way point of the journey. So it seemed that they have some limitations, presumably to ensure that the cost per passenger per flight doesn't exceed a certain amount. The seats were good an modern.

Customer service at Newark reaffirmed the airline would not foot the bill for a hotel because of those reasons for delay. I had travel insurance so was not worried about that too much. Eventually took off and once onboard, crew were fine and reasonably friendly. They waived the DirectTV fee due to the delay.

It is generally true for United that things were better in pre-Continental merger but it all ain't that bad either. I have flown the B767-400ER and B777 on several transatlantic routes this summer in both classes. I was surprised at how much more comfortable the B764 was as compared to the B777. The B777 felt packed (3-3-3 configuration in coach and awkward backward facing seats in business), while the B764 felt very spacious, clean and modern (2-3-2 in coach and 2-1-2 in business, all forward facing and not too many seats, so quieter). There were also no bothersome IFE equipment boxes under the window seats in coach. I would recommend searching routes that operate the B764 over the B777 - I really believe it is superior in terms of cabin layout and passenger comfort. BusinessFirst very comfortable flat bed seats (I am 179cm). Food quality ok, the main course was very good (beef with steamed vegetables) as well as the cheese and desert (nice detail they cut the cheese at your seat, so it feels fresh). The starter salad was very uncreative and plain bad actually, and no olive oil option as a dressing. But OK, it's an US airline so just don't expect any proper food to come out of that. Food in coach was also good with 3 separate serving rounds for appetiser, meal and desert+coffee. Great idea to hand out water bottles before the sleeping phase of the flight. Next time I will opt for the express dining option in business, as the full dining service takes so much time that you have little left for sleeping. Some people argue the seat configuration in business should be 1-2-1 rather than 2-1-2, but I disagree, while 1-2-1 is perfect for solo business travelers as everyone has isle access, I feel that when traveling with my partner (or any other person) I want to sit together by the window, so 2-1-2 does make sense to me.

This was one of my leisure travels where I was traveling with family and a younger sibling. BusinessFirst\" does consist of nice lie flat beds, you can lie flat and sleep for the most part; as well as the meals being consistently nice. This is something that I can say that United has done well over the past few years. As for the negatives. The businessfirst cabin is cramped.  Cram as many people together as close together to the point you can't but help to stare at your neighbors. Economy plus has a little bit more legroom but hardly worth the extra money if you have to pay for it. This older 767 has dated IFE, screens that are 4 inches wide and may you be lucky if they work. Seats in Econ+ are old, and often broken and hindered in legroom by the IFE boxes. That being said there is extreme value in the price of a UA ticket. The tickets are often $200 cheaper than competing airlines. Furthermore the cabins are grungy, dirty and not clean. You notice a felling of stale air and dirt the second you come into the cabin. I flew with my sibling who is a minor, very much a minor as he is still in elementary school. He was booked in United Economy on an award ticket, I in United Businessfirst paid. I asked the United Agents at checkin if he could sit with me in the business cabin as there where plenty of seats in the cabin still available. I was declined  because of the \"scarcity\" of meals  and asked once again when boarded if he could take an empty seat. The purser was kind enough to ask and with some humiliation, when I pressed him for an answer, he answered that there were not enough seats. As for experience onboard with the staff, it can vary 50/50. Staff are usually quite friendly in the business cabin; but this can also be a polar opposite with glaring stares, cold shoulder treatment and curt responses. Delays on United are not a surprise, they are the rule. I have missed countless engagements, meetings etc because of United's inability to stick to schedule. Again this flight was no different.

We\u2019ve flown a lot over the years but have never experienced an airline service quite as bad as this one. After a long flight from Sydney we faced a 6-hour delay in San Francisco awaiting a connection to Chicago. At one point we boarded a plane and were preparing for take-off. The plane was actually waiting on the runway for the go ahead to fly. Astoundingly, we get a cabin announcement informing us that we were to be taken back to the terminal as the pilot had gone over his assigned \u2018flight hours\u2019 and couldn\u2019t fly the plane. You couldn\u2019t make this stuff up. Confusion reigned for the next few hours while United staff gave conflicting information. Firstly, we were told to stay on the plane and wait for a replacement pilot. We were then told we\u2019d need to disembark. One said we'd definitely be flying that day while another said we might not as they might not be able to get a pilot. Eventually, a pilot did arrive and we did fly out that day. Unfortunately, the return leg didn\u2019t improve. We were scheduled to fly from Newark airport to San Fran where we would catch another flight to Sydney. As time was tight between when the flight from Newark was due to arrive and our connection from San Fran was due to depart, we decided to arrive at Newark airport early to see if we could change to an earlier flight. We were told by a rather surly United staff member that all earlier flights were fully booked. Strangely \u2013 when I checked my baggage in, the check in screen told me that for $75.00 I could take an earlier flight. After passing security, we decided to go to the United lounge and ask service staff about any other options for taking an earlier flight. When staff saw the tight connection time between the two flights they were in disbelief. They told us that this was an illegal connection and we should not have been able to even book it. They then offered to put us on standby and as it happened, we were able to get an earlier flight. On arrival at San Fran, my wife noted that an email had been sent to her from her work. When we hadn\u2019t boarded our \u2018booked\u2019 flight from Newark our flight from San Francisco to Sydney had been cancelled. Service staff confirmed this and notified that our booked seats had already been sold and we might not be able to get seats on the flight. We were eventually assigned new seats but we might as well have saved our money and gone economy. Passengers were walking through the cabin all night and we had to put up with a screaming baby and the stench of diaper changes. The service was woeful and I\u2019ve had better in economy on other airlines. Our seats hadn\u2019t been cleaned properly - there was rubbish and the screen control device was so sticky and dirty my wife had to wipe it down herself. Finally, when we arrived in Sydney we went to the baggage claim. After waiting an hour for our baggage we decided to check where it might be. Surprise, our baggage was still in San Fran. This despite asking United staff numerous times that our luggage was on the flights and receiving their full assurances. The service person in Sydney noted it was a common occurrence with United. When we turned around there was a line of United customers with the same issue. I realise others have had far worse flight experience, but ours wasn\u2019t great.

My negative experiences with the airline date back to 2007. As for the present trip under review from New York LaGuardia to Chicago, here are the most relevant issues. First, the flight was delayed leaving the airport by over two hours. There was no explanation given for what led to the delay while we waited at the gate. Second, the space between seats is simply unfairly small. I am a 5' 10\" man who is not at all overweight. And yet, my knees were pressed firmly against the seat in front of me, and the space was so small that I could not open my laptop computer to do work on the flight (my laptop is a MacBook Air, the thinnest model). Third, once in Chicago airspace we were told we could not land and circled the airport for close to an hour. When it finally appeared that we were going to land, the landing was aborted at the very last moment and were re-routed to Detroit. The problem: no information was given that we were heading there, just a little surprise when we arrived at a different airport. Upon exiting the plane, there were no gate agents there to help with booking connecting flights, only the personnel who dealt with lost luggage. I could actually say more negative things about this flight but am limited by space. Suffice it to say that I will absolutely never fly United again unless they are literally the only option in getting to my destination city.

I don't eat meat and have learned that \"Asian vegetarian\" tends to be better quality than regular vegetarian. The \"Asian vegetarian\" suppers were reasonable in both directions, although there was nothing at all Asian about the GRU to ORD supper (soy burgers plus rice and vegetables). The ORD to GRU supper was quite good and (except maybe for the curried tofu) quite South Asian. It even came with plain yogurt. However, United should be embarrassed by the breakfasts (in both directions), which consisted entirely of a stale roll and a tiny package of jam. People who didn't request a special meal got a croissant and a sweetened yogurt, which would have been just as \"Asian vegetarian\" as what I did get. My seatmate who (unlike me) is actually South Asian was just furious. This is the sort of thing that undermines United's improving reputation. Asian and most European airlines are much more generous about breakfasts and usually provide vegetarians (and everyone else) with a full meal. Let me add that I complained about the breakfast on the GRU to ORD flight to an FA as gently as I could, and she very nicely supplied me with a regular breakfast.

However this flight was also delayed, so we managed to rush on despite arriving late and being caught in security checks and waiting for baggage which did not arrive on the belt. Not the airline's fault, but do check with Houston airport staff if your baggage needs to be collected at the luggage belt at Houston to be re-checked, because ours didn't need to be but we did not know. This flight was on a newer 738, but no in-flight entertainment. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a pasta, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). Flight was delayed presumably by bad weather at Houston, but also because they were slow with loading the luggage (I could see from my window they were still loading the luggage even past the departure time). In the end, unfortunately my luggage did not make it from my delayed UA6 to my delayed UA1461, and I had to proceed to their airport staff at San Salvador airport to lodge a case. I have to give them credit for being rather efficient in locating my luggage, putting it on the next flight that night, and delivering it to me the next day by noon - this whole process could have gone much worse, so I am glad it was well-handled. Overall, UA did not turn out as bad as I had expected it to be for my first time, even though I did experience my first diversion and delayed luggage, despite having flown regularly for many years with other airlines."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "June 2016", "review": "UA1541 (Tegucigalpa - Houston, 737 / Boeing 737-700), UA1699 (Houston - San Francisco, 789 / Boeing 787-900), and UA1 (San Francisco - Singapore, 789) on 17 Jun 2016. First, UA1541. Surprised to see that there was a personal screen, but it was with DirecTV and pre-recorded movies, and not available free of charge. However, in the end movies were made available free of charge, presumably due to slight delays on the ground at the start of the flight. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a wrap, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). I had wanted the sandwich but it was out of stock. Next, UA1699. In-flight entertainment was miles ahead since it was newer, though I notice the selection was less compared to my next sector which was a 16-hour international flight. Food was available for purchase, though the usual snacks and drinks were available free-of-charge. I did not buy anything, and survived on a zesty snack pack with Sprite. My seat was supposed to be window seat, but the window was misaligned so I had to lean forward to gaze outside. It was great to have no one sitting next to me in the middle, which enhanced the amount of space available considering that the Dreamliner in 3-3-3 seating is known to be rather cramped. Finally, UA1, newly launched earlier this month. I had expected it to be very painful to fly 16 hours on a cramped 787. It turned out to be uncomfortable but still bearable. Managed to get some light sleep, managed to be sufficiently entertained too. What failed me was the food. The first meal (dinner), I made the wrong choice and had a (vegetarian, but you dont know until you get it) pasta with just spinach, cheese and tomato sauce. Salad was as usual horrible. Luckily the ice-cream saved the day. In between I missed the turkey ham roll as I was asleep, but it was available at the back of the plane for self-service. That was helpful to stave off hunger pangs. The second meal (breakfast) was literally the worst in-flight meal I ever had. I did not have a choice as they had run out of the eggs, so there was only a (vegetarian again) noodle in some funky weird black sauce, with weird tasting mushroom, edamame (horrible again) and red pepper. Absolute disaster, so bad that my neighbour and I did not finish the food. Without the bun and butter I would have starved. Seat comfort-wise, legroom and width was okay though my friend who was a bit bigger sized and seated at the aisle could feel a significant narrower seat width compared to the other flights - his shoulders were up against the neighbour in the middle seat. Overall, service and food on board seemed to be not as good as my outbound flights from NRT to SAL via IAH, though the in-flight entertainment was better on the newer Dreamliner."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "June 2016", "review": "\u2705 Verified Review |  Rolled off the pad at Heathrow quicker than expected, touched down at Newark about 45mins early.

As we have tried Air India before, and we have not flown long haul with United for a long time, we decided to try out United's much touted \"new cabin experience\" in Economy class, where a \"three course meal\" would be presented, as well as improved services for Economy passengers. We had hoped United had improved since the last, disastrous time we flew them in 2013, but alas. It is the same lacklustre airline. Check in at EWR was relatively painless, and the TSA, is the TSA. We boarded and left relatively on time, and so far, things looked alright. And we were wrong about that. The 777-200 was old, to say the least, and in a shabby condition. The seats were worn and my recline didn't work- needless to say, for a 14 hour flight, this was simply not good enough, United. I was given a free drink to compensate, but a drink doesn't help you when you're stuck in an upright and uncomfortable position for 14 hours at 6 feet 3. My second gripe with this flight was the crew - and what a surly bunch they were. The \"three course meal\" much touted was not there - instead, we got served an awful mix of barbecue sauce and chicken, rice, and uncooked vegetables. There was no initial drinks run, and everything was served on one, tiny tray and due to this, our portion sizes were far too small. My son (aged 9) didn't eat anything for 12 hours. Breakfast was little better, with a choice between an uncooked omelette and an Indian vegetarian meal. The only saving grace of this flight was the IFE, but the screens were worn and did not respond to touch controls and the remotes in the armrest did not work. We have flown flights of similar length on Qatar or Emirates, and it is important to note how wonderful the food was, on those 16 hour voyages, and the plentiful snacks (I say \"snacks\", they were literally meals), and the courteous crews. There was none of that on a United flight of similar, or even longer length. The abysmal meals, disinterested and indifferent crews (who were nowhere to be seen after the initial meal service), and the shabby, worn condition of the plane and seats mean that I do not recommend United on such long haul flights of more than 10 hours.

After embarking a 25 mins delayed we would sit and wait in the plane for almost an hour, while we were let to know in different ways that we are ready to leave soon. Upon arrival, again little information, even though all conducting passengers obviously had lost their flights' departures. After waiting in line on an under staffed customer service, we were given the usual tricky hotel voucher trip and sent on a mission to find out how to get there. First on our way to a bus stop with such bad descriptions that almost all passengers were lost on the way to find the shuttle bus. Maybe because no one would actually think that we were supposed to cross an insecure road and go through a road construction site for finding it? After asking bus drivers from other hotel services we waited for 25 minutes for the shuttle to the Weston hotel. Now time had gone and the kitchen where we could use the 10 dollars worth coupon for 'a meal' where there happens to be no meals so cheap. As a partner of United Airlines, this hotel also comes without a complimentary internet connection service. I will not trust UA again unless they change information and passenger handling significantly, and I will as much as possibletry to avoid flying with them.

The airline charges per suitcase. The female employee who was checking boarding passes at Buffalo was extremely rude. She got flustered when I pointed out that she had not given my niece's passport back to her and she stated, \"I thought you were all together! Next time you need to get here earlier. I almost unseated all of you!\" To which I replied that we had looked up what time to be there on United's website and it stated to be there an hour and a half before your flight, which we were. There was no entertainment available unless you brought your own hand held device. If you had your own hand held device, but didn't have earbuds or headphones, they didn't have any for you. It took my son six hours to watch a two hour movie because the WiFi kept shutting down. They charged us for the meals on a 9 hr flight - charged us for the Italian sandwich, which is what we ordered, but they gave us the turkey sandwich which was cheaper. If the food has improved (as I've seen from some reviews), I would have hated to eat it before. The seating was cramped and uncomfortable. We tried to upgrade and were told we couldn't. We were traveling with six people all together. They ruined 3 of the suitcases, one of them brand new. The steward staff on the return flight from Maui were very nice, polite, and professional, but it did not make up for all that we had already experienced. I won't take United again if it can be avoided.

I was originally booked to fly from Boston to London via Washington-Dulles airport but around 8 hours before departure, I received a notification that the flight from Boston to DC had been canceled. I called United and got through to a friendly agent who confirmed  that I had already been rebooked onto a new itinerary via Newark that would get me to London only 3 hours later than originally planned. She booked me into an economy plus seat as I am a silver member and apologized for the cancelation. The check-in process had a couple minor problems at Boston as the self-service machine would not print a bag tag for me but an agent quickly assisted me at the counter. Boarding process was efficient -the new automatic ticket scanning gates at terminal B in Boston definitely speed up the process. I gate-checked one of my carry ons because it was too large to fit in the overhead bin. Onboard the short flight from BOS to EWR, there was personal device entertainment, which was a pleasant surprise as this was on a very small EMB-170 aircraft, which usually has no entertainment. Onboard service was minimal on this 45 minute flight and only water was offered. Nevertheless it was a comfortable flight. There was one small hiccup in the trip on arrival at Newark airport when I had to wait around 10 minutes to get my carry on back from gate check but I retrieved it in the end and everything went well with the connection. The long flight from Newark to London was very good with courteous and attentive flight attendants. Dinner was served promptly after take-off and the food was decent by airline standards. The only disappointment was that there was no dessert except for a small pot of sorbet which had a strange taste, and water was strangely only provided after the meal instead of before. Entertainment options were plentiful with personal device entertainment or seat back on demand with a varied selection. Seats were comfortable when reclined and there was plenty of leg room in economy plus. Upon arrival in London, the baggage claim process was very efficient and the bags were already on the belt by the time I got through customs. Overall, a seamless, comfortable and relaxed trip with United. In the past, I have had trouble with United but they are quickly learning from their mistakes and improving greatly.

I have never gone so far as to publically give a rating or review in my 45 years of being on this earth. However, sorry to say I just had to this time. We recently were returning from vacation where my sons anxiety disorder worsened considerably and we had to get home quickly. We had the worst flying experience in all of our flying history. We had never flown United before. Never will again. My son has a medical issue as I mentioned. I planned ahead and paid for premium seats to assure we were all sitting together. Our flight before that came in with about 10 minutes to spare for us to board this connecting flight. By the time we got there, people were still in line to board. However, the desk agent \"removed\" us from the trip. They quickly realized that this decision was a little premature so they offered us some open seat tickets. None of course were next to each other. However, this is why I spent an hour on the phone with United the night before...to make sure we were together in case something happened with my son. I asked if they would be willing to talk to the other customers(travelers) and see if anyone would be willing to switch seats with us as it was the agent who removed us in the first place. He simply walked away. When he came back, I asked if we could resolve this. Apparently the lady next to him was already assigning the extra tickets now to someone else. We now with no choice of our own had to wait for the next flight which I luckily had pre-booked the night before just in case we truly did miss the connection. Only because united had sent us an email that the first flight was already delayed by an hour and a half. All during the process of this the desk agent kept talking to other people, never once apologized for the stress he was causing. He was extremely rude, and said that unless my son has a heart issue or has an oxygen tank that it wasnt his problem. When my son heard this, it immediately hit a nerve and the guilt of us having to deal with this agent in this way and the frustratingly awful customer service sent my son into a debilitating anxiety attack (looks like a seizure). Yet still the agent continued to be defensive. Not one apology, or assistance from anyone at that desk. Clearly, the trouble I had for over an hour on the phone with United the night before made no difference. When I asked if there was someone I could speak with to get further assistance I was told \"yeah, its called online'. Once we boarded, the level of professionalism was atrocious. The flight attendants could be heard talking about the men they dated, rammed the drink cart along passenger seats multiple times, could barely be bothered to actually listen to your order, forget about asking for a blanket.

An FA willingly reset it and then checked, and when it still did not recover, gave me a coupon which I later used online to add 5,000 points to my Mileage Plus account. The inflight wifi also did not work for me 90 percent of the time, but my neighbour could use it it, albeit with very slow up and down speeds. One has to apply online for a refund. The Boeing 787 LAX-MEL was still new and fully functional, and this time the food was edible, though the portions were minuscule, and with dinner service about 1 hour after lift off and breakfast about 1 hour before landing, the 12-13 hours without food in between seemed long, even to me who is not a big eater, though one can buy food from the food for purchase menu. The crew on this leg were short on customer service skills, barking out requests, never a \"please\" or \"thank you\" and not a single hydration round. They seemed pretty sour about something, but when I went to the rear galley to find an empty restroom, a few of them were sitting around and chatting in a very jovial way with each other. Toilets not maintained at all for the 15 hours. Even so, we were on time, things went efficiently, the IFE choices were good, and the IFE system on the B789 was very good. If the hard product on the old 772s is upgraded and the effort to promote customer service skills among cabin crew continues, the improvement in United's service I've noticed over the last couple of years might just continue."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "April 2016", "review": "\u2705 Verified Review |  We had 4 flights with United Airlines, first flight was from Manchester UK to Newark.

About an hour later, with everyone waiting in line, they told us that there was a leaky hydrolics and they would need to send in a part from either Houston or Chicago, they weren't sure.

In Toronto, we pulled away from the gate on time, and sat on the runway for over 90 minutes, with the pilot telling us periodically that there was \"bad\" turbulence in Washington, and we'd be advised as soon as he heard anything. After 90 minutes, he turned back to the gate for refueling without having heard anything more. Some passengers were able to get rerouted immediately but the ground crew told us no issues - if there was bad turbulence, our connections would be backed up too. After 45m on the ground we went back out and eventually landed at Dulles. But our connecting flights had all left, so waited another 45m to get an alternate flight (Friday at noon). CSR said the issue was air traffic, not turbulence, so not their problem that we haven't any place to stay here and an expensive, paid-for hotel room waiting for us in Greensboro. After being questioned more insistently, the CSR grudgingly gave us a voucher that got us a discounted (not free!) hotel room. Back to the airport today - at 10:30, 11, 11:30, the board still showed our flight as \"on time\". After the scheduled boarding time of noon came and went, checked with the gate agent - flight is now delayed to 3pm. We can only hope, since if they cancel it (the flight isn't full) and put us on the 5pm flight, we won't make Greensboro in time for the concert. I'll hopefully never fly United again.

When we tried to pick up our baggage in Dubai, airport staff said UAE visa is required to go to baggage claim area and since we did not have UAE visa, they didn't allow us to pick up our baggage.

If United had informed us about those issues when we bought the ticket or even at the airport, none of those problems would have happened. I asked United to reimburse us for all those extra costs but they only offered us two $150 flight certificates, which are basically useless, most of the time United tickets are more expensive than other flights and those $150 dollar certificates hardly have $20 cash value each.

They called me very distressed because the United agent told them they couldn't fly them to Los aneles until January 2, the day they had to return home. Our family then went on line and found an Amercan flight that would get them to Los Angeles in time to get to the Rose Bowl game on New Years. In the aftermath I contacted United costumer service, The person I told my story to on the phone said \u201cThats unfortunate we have an agreement with American and should have been able to get you on that flight.\u201d They told me how to online apply for compensation, so I submitted my claim. The person who responded to my claim said they could refund the unused portion of the ticket to Los Angeles but they could not refund the flight we had purchased on our own. So in summary on the day of the flight United was unable to get my boys where they were supposed to and said they couldn't get them there for 2 days. We were able to find a flight that salvaged part of the trip on an airline United had access to. Then they refused to reimburse me for booking the flight they should have found themselves.

Then on our return flight on January 8, 2016, our flights were all delayed, starting from Santa Fee and at Denver, it was a nightmare for my mother and I. She needed wheelchair assistance and we had to request for it twice because the gates got changed, like 5 minutes we were dumped at the first gate. At the second gate, we were advised on the Departure screens that the gate was now somewhere else, even further from the original gate. In the end, my mother got fed up and walked to the last gate where we finally got a rep who was very professional and patient. The information on the Departure screen was confusing as both United and Air Canada were shown to be departing at the same gate but with 5 minutes difference.

The Boeing 787-9 we flew in was a new aircraft, the cabin does feel airier, with larger windows, and improved lighting. The cabin crew on this flight was a mix bag of very senior flight attendants who were quite stand off-ish, to younger flight attendants who were very nice, attentive and friendly. United has upped its game in catering for the Business First cabin and it shows. Portions were plentiful, wines good, and choices good. The mid-flight snacks left on the credenza at the forward most section of the cabin and in the mid-Business cabin galley were basic and not great, but not an issue, given the large dinner service. Breakfast was served 90 minutes out of Melbourne. Flight departed on time and arrived 30-35 minutes ahead of schedule. If United can replicate the service and feel of the 787-9 to its other aircraft cabins on long haul flights, then it might have turned a corner. The LAX terminal it operates from is dingy, dirty, and has zero to offer in terms of comfort. It is supposed to be upgraded. Not soon enough.

Rather, the announcement was for volunteers to check in their hand luggage as the plane was completely overbooked. They also requested for volunteers who would offer up their seat since they oversold ticket! The flight back from Orlando was much more horrible, flight was delayed from MCO and this almost impacted on the connecting flight at Washington. No seats were allocated at check in, we had to wait and wait as they kept increasing the duration of the delay of the first leg of my journey.

So in all, we had to thrash the first boarding pass given at check in without seats, and got another boarding pass by the boarding gate. On landing at Washington, we had to race out of the aircraft and onto the other gate as there was no plan for the plane to wait and we couldn\u2019t afford to miss the flight as there was no other flight to London by United.

I overhead her tell people that she's heard it all, vacations, family gatherings, job responsibilities. She showed absolutely no empathy for any of the customers with their concerns. She didn't refrain from just yelling at customers, she shared the same love with the employees. \"I only have 2 hands, you'll have to figure it out on your own\". I felt so bad for everyone that experienced the \"help\" of this woman. This woman was the supervisor! It's a wonder why the other employees didn't feel the need to provide good customer service. It was simply, the flight is cancelled, we can get you there on the 2nd. That wasn't an option for us and they didn't provide any other solutions. Except another rep did suggest that we take the Amtrak down to Texas to catch our connecting flight. After hours of sitting in the airport trying to come up with a solution. We thought, how about driving to Denver? So we reluctantly went back to the counter to inquire on flights. Thankfully! We spoke with a male agent who was efficient and polite as possible, he booked our flight with a smile. It was reassuring that he took the time to explain to us the procedure. We left knowing that we had another option. Ironically, while waiting in line for our confirmation, I saw the supervisor walk by with a smile! However, the smile was because she was criticizing someone for duct taping the top of a water bottle. She was shaking her head and name calling. But from afar, one would think she actually liked her job. I am hesitant to ever fly United again. Constant cancellations and delays. According to Supervisor lady, it's always due to weather. When in actuality, it was due to the fact that they had no crew due to the 8 hours wait time. If they weren't short staffed, the weather excuse would not exist.

He must have made either the Captain or First Officer nervous because we came in way too high and had to abort the landing, so around we went again by which time we had no chance of catching our flight to Orlando. The Captain informed us that the aborted landing was due to 'wind'. Yeh right, don't insult your passengers intelligence! On the ground we went to the United desk to get seats on the next flight down to Orlando. Desk clerk informed us that although we had four 'first class' seats booked and paid for, there were only three first class seats available, therefore one of the party would have to take a seat in 'coach'. OK these thing happen but we would obviously get a refund of the difference (about $250). That was in March 2015 - we made the claim in April 2015 on our return to the UK. Our travel agent received an offer from United of $100 and chose to make up the difference because of the trade we give him. We are still waiting for the refund from United! I travelled regularly between Birmingham UK and Jacksonville FL when the company was Continental with no problems. Since United have taken over, the airline is a disgrace. Having had a rubbish flight from London Heathrow to San Francisco on United a few years ago I was dubious about flying with them again. My doubts were well founded. Never again!

I am American, but live in the UK, so I make frequent trips to the US with my 6 year old daughter. I make an enormous effort not to fly any US carriers when I travel because the inflight experience is on average materially worse than virtually any other airline I know of. United however takes the cake as the worst. The reason I write this review is not because we were stranded overnight somewhere or held up on a tarmac for hours on end. I write this review because of the simple, every day occasions where United flight attendants and staff make flying unpleasant. On one flight, I sat with my sleeping daughter in my lap, call light on, for about 20 mins just to request a cup of water. I finally get the attention of a flight attendant, and she boldly waves me off and never comes to offer assistance. On my last flight, the flight attendant was so impolite at my request for 3 beverages between my daughter and me, I wondered if she was personally bearing the cost of the drinks. Today, I'm connecting through Chicago, and my minor daughter and I are not sitting together. At bag check in, they couldn't reseat me. And at the gate, I swear the steward took pleasure in not being able to do anything to reassign our seats. Instead of offering apologies, he blankly stared at me and repeated - word for word - a useless statement that I'd have to ask for assistance on board. Not only did this leave my 6 year old daughter crying, but after asking 4 people already, I'm to believe that the crew on board are going to do anything? It seems reasonable that United Airlines should be able to ensure children aren't flying alone; but even if they can't, you'd think their staff might not be so put out by their own jobs that they're wholly insensitive to the distress they're causing passengers. If anyone at United - or more importantly, the unions - is reading this review, it might help to prepare your employees for a career in public relations, or perhaps train them in being less hostile to paying customers."}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "December 2015", "review": "I was travelling from Tokyo Haneda to Pittsburgh, and I'm giving this review because of the way United Airlines handled its business in light of a few storms that made travel difficult.

I know its the winter months. A lot of people traveling and some potential for delays. However I plan for that. Something United Airlines failed to do. When I learned my flight was delayed and I would miss my connection, I went to the service desk. The line had about 30 people who were having the same issue. The two women working behind the desk were assisting about 1 person every 40 minutes. I'm sure you can do the math on how long this process took. Why United Airlines couldn't have more than 2 people working during the busiest months of the year when you're charging that much for a flight is beyond me.

One of these passengers included a woman with a baby, from whom the flight attendant grumpily took a purse and roughly shoved it into the overhead.

When we asked to board first in order to avoid hitting anyone on the head with the car seat we were met with rude responses about how it's not policy to let families board first, and that we should just be more careful while boarding. Policy or not you risk people getting injured by not letting us board prior. We are just asking to get situated so others are not inconvienced by our child's needs.

We land in Newark and sprint to our gate with minutes to spare and were told \"that flight was cancelled\" and directed us to customer service. We wait in line for about 5 minutes before a rep states to the crowd, \"we are closing, you need to go to the other customer service line.\" We wait for about 45 minutes in the new line.

He asks if we'd be willing to split up and we explain that we'd rather not. He suggests a flight to Boston. I tell him we have no way to Portland after that and he says to call family (it's past midnight). I say that's not an option, but the rep still pushed it. 5 minutes later he suggests a 10am flight for us, we ask for that and give him our boarding passes. He scans mine and says, \"so how were you planning on getting to Portland?\" I say, \"what do you mean? with that boarding pass I just gave you.\" He explains that the flight was cancelled due to weather, which at this point we had known for hours. I say, \"yes, that's why we're trying to get on the 10a flight tomorrow.\" He says that our flight ends in Newark. At this point my husband and I were extremely confused because our passes clearly stated Portland. He suggests a rental car. We sleep in the airport for a few hours and rent a car. He never gave us boarding passes, and almost lost my husbands baggage claim ticket. Our TA spent a long time going back and forth with United customer service. We were confirmed for a 6am flight, despite not receiving boarding passes. She tried to get them to refund us for our car but United stated that they \"don't reimburse for rental cars\".

The smaller Embraer jets are nice for the single traveler, as they're designed with a single seat on the right side, so you get both window and aisle. The extra leg room in economy plus seating is worth the extra expense ($30-$45 on the segments I flew). The seats themselves are adequate, but not comfortable. This is an industry wide problem, and not in any way unique to United. The biggest disappointment is the WiFi service. From previous experience, it seems to work very well on their Airbus fleet. The Airbus fleet usually does not have tv screens in the seat backs, so the WiFi service on those planes comes with a library of movies and TV shows to watch. This works very well if you've got a tablet or some other device to watch them on. The Boeing portion of their fleet is another matter entirely. The more recent planes have the TV screens in the seats. There's a basic program that runs during the flight, but if you want to watch anything else, there's a fee. The WiFi service on the Boeing aircraft also seems to be spotty at best. It hasn't worked at all on 3 of the 4 segments I've flown in the last couple months. The Embraer planes fly the short routes. I have yet to come across one of these with WiFi service or a seat back screen. But, given the flights I've been on have only been about 90 minutes, this isn't a big problem.

With no incentives to give to other passengers she found a way to get us seated together. Once aboard I was surprised to find that the flight did not include any type of in-flight entertainment, no screens and no audio. I gladly purchased it on the 5+ hr flight from EWR to PHX, but this was not even an option on the return. I was also surprised that there was NO safety demonstration given on the flight, which is definitely unsafe and possibly in violation of FAA rules.

However, I think that mainly applies to their domestic US operations. Perhaps because my expectations were low, I was pleasantly surprised.

The staff both on the ground and in the air were excellent, very friendly and professional. The inflight entertainment was so-so, but comparable in many ways to that of British Airways on my flight out. There was very little choice in the way of films and TV shows.Many of the TV shows only seemed to have one or two random episodes available to watch.The screen was pretty small though and it was really tricky to select the required item on the touch screen. The cursor kept on hovering over the wrong item. Although annoying, on a 7hr flight it did the job. The food was pretty mediocre I have to say - like a deeply budget ready meal. I know airline food is never going to be that great, but compared to other long haul flights i've taken recently with the likes of Cathay Pacific and even BA, it was pretty bad. Also, the wine on offer was from a juice carton which was ominous - it tasted like it was from a juice carton too. Not sure they'd be my first choice in the future, but not as bad as I was expecting.

However the customer service in regards to only allowing 2 pieces of carry-ons needs to be improved. Flight out of Seattle to Cincinnati via Houston had rude customer service at the boarding gate. If everyone is allowed 2 pieces of luggage to carry on, then the service on the plane also needs to follow and hold the passengers accountable, ie. one piece of luggage on top while the second piece must go underneath the seat. Just because I do not pay the extra to fly first class, does not mean my luggage is less important. I'm a frequent flyer with United (140k in miles), or at least I was until this past weekend, so you would think that making sure each and every customer would be valued by United. Flying back from Cincinnati to Seattle, via D.C. was just atrocious. Arrived in Cincinnati, only to find my flight was delayed 30 mins due to a late inbound flight - but why did it take United 20 mins before I was to board my plane to email me that information? Then another 20 mins later, received an email that the flight was delayed another 30 mins and the gate changed (luckily just the gate over). My connecting flight out of D.C. to Seattle would surely be missed as I would still be in the air while my flight to my final destination would be taking off. Many of us were in similar predicaments. We were speaking with the woman at the boarding gate, and she advised us our flight was out of the original gate (A11). Then when we all showed her our email from United stating our gate was out of A13, so needed to radio down to ask. One person came back on the radio that the flight to D.C. was out of A11, while another person responded with out of A13. When the gate was determined, the woman at the boarding gate now needed to find if the flight to D.C. was first or if the flight to Houston was next as boarding was soon going to happen. Needless to say, my flight was messed up and I ended up staying in Cincinnati for another night. The next day (Oct. 12), I attempted to fly out of Cincinnati to Seattle via Houston. As soon as I arrived at the airport, I yet again received an email from United that my flight was delayed. Surely this wasn't all going to happen again. I was flying out of the same gate, so perhaps? With that flight being late, we were not sure if I would make the connecting flight to Seattle out of Houston. My flight from Cincinnati to Houston was a little over 2 hours and all passengers were able to get a full can of soda. Luckily, passengers were nice and allowed people at the back of the plane to get off in order to maybe make their connection. Rushed to make the connection and the women at the gate were extremely rude. We told one that others were coming from the late flight out of Cincinnati and her response was \"We cannot hold the gate for anyone. You can stay and wait and see if the rest of you party makes it though, but we cannot hold the gate for anyone.\". The second woman (taking the boarding tickets) was just as rude. Again the whole you can only have 2 pieces of luggage is fine, but when you are following the rules, having to check your bag at the gate is absurd when United does not actually enforce the \"the second bag must go under the seat.\".

We are traveling with a 14 month old, a 5 year old and a 7 year old, and we paid extra so that we could sit together and received confirmation to that affect. This was done two months ago. Today, the day before the flight, we received a \"check in\" email but when attempting this, the seats were scattered and the five year old was not even reflected to be on the plane. Needless to say, we called Customer Service and after an hour long phone call they could not or would not correct their admitted errors and admitted to charging us for something they then took away without notice. They suggested we handle this at the gate tomorrow. I have zero confidence. Traveling with kids is difficult enough, but enduring the childlike behavior from United Airlines is pathetic. So since this matter is still fluid and United Airlines has an opportunity to read their reviews, and perhaps correct their errors, I put them to the challenge.

They had three options on our previous flight on the way out, but only one left- chicken and potatoes, but without the potatoes.

I was surprised to see snacks being sold during the flight between meals. Other airlines would give out snacks for free on an 11 hour flight. Most of the flight crew were unfriendly and there was little communication from pilots or crew. The biggest disappointment was the entertainment. United Airlines do not have seat back entertainment on their 747's in economy. Instead there were just a few screens around the cabin. The screens were too far away from most seats, especially if you were sitting nearer the windows. Very disappointing that in 2015, a major airline would still operate like this on a long-haul flight.

Taxiing after landing at Newark took a while (no fault of United) and disembarking was a little bit lengthy. Due to the plane being a narrow body (3-3 layout) it made the flight feel a bit cramped, however, as there were 3 of us travelling together, it meant we could all sit together.

He and his mother were changed to two premium seats in the front bulkhead and we were had to keep our two premium seats in the exit row over the engine, and with no window shades.

The FA dealt with this situation by inserting a flight safety procedures card into the window frame and then a folded newspaper which kept falling out.

Then the plane was just delayed leaving its first departure city and we were never told why just that as soon as it gets in we would be on our way. This is just ridiculous.

Secondly, they had no one at the desk to assist customers trying to find a new flight and when I finally found someone at a different gate, who was semi helpful, she informed me that the next flight out would be 15 mins before my new scheduled departure time.

The customer service rep in Toronto was particularly nasty and actually slowed down the entire process by training a new employee while talking to us. It should be noted, that I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter who had not eaten for many hours and the slow processing and communications by this rep meant that nearly all of the shops and restaurants in the airport had closed down for the night. I asked if we could be put on another airline and was told that this was 'not allowed'. I also asked if we could get a flight somewhere near Dublin and was only offered a flight to Turkey or Frankfurt the next night. The rep did not offer hotel vouchers or food vouchers or any practical resolution, but only intentionally took her time scanning flights. The employee finally got us a flight to London the next night and rooms in the adjacent hotel. If we had not fought for hours, late at night, we would have been left to sleep in the chairs of the airport with my 5 year old daughter. While I am grateful that we finally were able to get on another flight - to London, then Dublin through British Airways - we missed 2 days of our trip. Coming home we had another ordeal with United. The return flight which was changed to a departure in Dublin to Washington D.C. and then, on to LaGuardia was actually worse. While turbulence cannot be helped, one of the flight attendants hit her head. This meant that paramedics had to care for the attendant first, which delayed our flight and caused us to miss our flight home. I had to rent a car to get home.

The same goes for WiFi which they claimed was available, but did not work even on a flight within the mainland US.

On May 29th my direct flight from Dulles to Kuwait was diverted to Istanbul. The pilots timed out and passengers were stranded for over 12 hours in Istanbul- with no Turkish visas nor United staff to re-book and assist with hotels (United has no service in Istanbul, agents were eventually flown in from the Middle East). Indeed diversions are neither planned nor pleasant; however, passengers anticipated United would have had a contingency protocol in place for such events. After being left to fend for ourselves, and spending hours on the phone (international roaming) with customer care, passengers finally reached Kuwait the following day to ultimately learn that the remainder our respective original itinerary were canceled meaning onward travel and return flights to the US had to be re-booked. Shockingly, United did not apologize for the inconvenience and (as of today- eg. 23 days later) has not offered to reimburse visa-on-arrival fees in Turkey nor the international roaming fees passengers encountered while trying on the phone with United\u2019s \u201cCustomer Care\u201d team. Furthermore, all passengers paid for the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, boarded the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, and apparently since United diverted to Istanbul, zero miles for the Dulles to Kuwait leg will be applied to passengers\u2019 account as credit toward their annual status - seems unfair if United accepted the payment for the flight and we all boarded the flight. After over a dozen conversations with \u201cCustomer Care\u201d leading all the way up to the Senior Manager for Global Services, I am deeply disappointed to say the agreed upon follow-up that was supposed to occur 5 days ago has not. The Senior Manager did have one of his subordinates send an e-mail stating they will be in contact as soon as they reach a conclusion to my request. Wouldn\u2019t it have been nice to receive a message stating \u201cThank you again for continued business and patience, we value your business and as a customer and respectfully offer our apologies for the inconvenience, reimbursement for the incurred expenses, and credit of the earned miles\u201d ?"}, {"airline": "Untied", "date_flown": "May 2015", "review": "Domestic First Class/International Business Class, ORD-EWR-MXP.

Stated I did not trust United with the shorter connection despite it being legal when challenged and the agent made the change without further comment. The outbound flight was late due to weather. Unfortunately all other EWR flights were showing on time as was the departure to MXP. Little communication from gate staff in Chicago.

Much better, especially seat comfort and reliability, except for the food which I always find a bit odd on LH. Frankly, I am starting to pick other airlines when I am in business class and I have the choice. In my opinion, United has become very undependable, both from a timeliness and baggage delivery standpoint, since the merger.
